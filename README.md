Vim-history
-----------

This repository contains the old source code of Vim. It basically consists of two parts:

* Source Commits from the old [CVS repository][1] at the [sourceforge project page][2]  
  This contains the history for the releases 5.5 to 6.4 and have been created by using `git cvsimport` (see [documentation][3]).

* Commits for the even older releases from releases 1.14 until 5.5  
  Those commits have been created from the tarballs at the Vim FTP site:

  * <http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/old/>  
    (v1.14 - v2.8, v4.0 - v4.5)
  * <http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/>  
    (v3.0, v4.6, v5.0 - v5.5)
  * <http://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/extra/>  
    (v5.0 - v5.5)

  Those older commits are not the TRUE history.
  (E.g. commit dates are faked. They are based on the dates from `src/version.c` or `src/version.h`.)

Initially those two parts were two separate repositories. However they have been merged into a single repository using
```bash
git replace --graft 686757e4d2a46c8ab55c08c7a0ccd v5.5
git filter-branch v5.5..HEAD
```

Some tags were updated [manually][11].


Release History
---------------

The following table summarizes the previous release dates according to several sources.

Data has been taken from the

 * [Vim FAQ][4]
 * a youtube video of [Brams presentation on Vim][5] (1:37)
 * Wikipedia article on [Vim][6]
 * Announcements in the mailinglist [vim-announce][9]
 * Announcements in the [comp.editors][12] news group
 * Date of the release tags in the CVS repository (now available in the [vim-ancient repository][7])
 * Date of the release tag in the current [Vim repository][8]
 * Source code (the date written in `src/version.h` or `src/version.c`)  E.g.
   ```
   $ git show v8.1.0000:src/version.h | grep '#define VIM_VERSION_LONG\>'
   $ git show v4.6:src/version.c | grep '\*longVersion'
   ```

Merge the whole history
-----------------------

If you want to see the whole history of Vim in your one local repository, try this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim
git remote add vim-history https://github.com/vim/vim-history.git
git fetch vim-history --tags
git replace --graft v7.0001 vim-6-3-004
```

This virtually connects the tag `v7.0001` on top of the tag `vim-6-3-004`. The development of Vim 7.0 was branched from around Vim 6.3.


Other repositories
------------------

* [vim-ancient][7]  
  This includes the history from v5.5 to v6.4.  
  This was converted from the old [CVS][1] repository at sourceforge.

* [official repository][8]  
  This includes the history from v7.0 to the latest release.
