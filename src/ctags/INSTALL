Simple makefiles are provided for a few environments.

    Makefile.amiga	For Amiga with Manx C
    Makefile.bcc	For Borland C/C++ on MSDOS
    Makefile.djg	For the Gnu GCC (DJGPP) compiler on MSDOS
    Makefile.os2	For OS/2 with EMX
    Makefile.unix	For UNIX flavors
    Makefile.w32	For Win32 with Visual C++ or Borland C++

If you are on a host which uses CR-LF newlines, you will need to make sure
that one of these labels is defined:  MSDOS, OS2, WIN32; or patch the code.
This causes the source files to be opened in binary mode since the fseek()
calls do not operate correctly without it.

Compile with -DINTERNAL_SORT if you desire sorted tags and/or warnings for
duplicate tags, but do not have the external programs "sort" and "awk"
available (i.e. other than UNIX). This label is automatically defined if
any of MSDOS, OS2, WIN32, or AMIGA are defined.
