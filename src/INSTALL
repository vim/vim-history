INSTALL - Installation of Vim on different machines.

This file contains instructions for compiling Vim. If you have an executable
version of Vim you don't need this.

Contents:
1. Generic
2. Amiga
3. MSDOS
4. Win32 (Windows NT and Windows 95)
5. Archimedes
6. Macintosh
7. Unix
8. OS/2 (with EMX 0.9b)
9. Atari MiNT


1. Generic
==========

The file "feature.h" can be edited to match your preferences. You can skip
this, then you will get the default behaviour as is documented, which should
be fine for most people.


2. Amiga
========

Summary:
make -f makefile.manx		Manx C
make -f makefile.sas		Lattice/SAS C
make -f makefile.dice		DICE

The Manx compiler is preferred, it was used to produce the Amiga executable
and has been tested most. You should not get any errors or warnings.

The SAS compiler can be used. Older versions (6.0 to 6.3) don't work with the
optimizer switched on. This seems to be fixed with 6.5 or 6.56, but this has
not been tested much.

The DICE makefile works, but it has only been tested by one person.

You will have to set the "VIM" environment variable to the location of the
documentation files.


3. MSDOS
========

Summary:
ren makefile makefile.uni
ren makefile.bcc makefile; make		Borland C++ and Turbo C++
ren makefile.dos makefile; make		Turbo C
make -f makefile.djg			DJGPP 2.0

Warning: Be sure to use the right make.exe. Microsoft C make doesn't work,
Borland make only works with makefile.bcc and makefile.dos, DJGPP/GNU make
must be used for makefile.djg.

The Borland C++ compiler has been used to generate the MS-DOS executable, it
should work without problems. You will probably have to change the paths for
LIBPATH and INCLUDEPATH in the start of the makefile. If you don't have the
spawno library, try to get it (e.g. from Simtel), or follow the instructions
in the makefile to remove the use of spawno. You will get two warnings which
can be ignored (one about _chmod and one about precompiled header files).

The Turbo C makefile has not been tested much lately. It is included for those
that don't have C++. You may need to make a few changes to get it to work.

DJGPP needs to be installed properly to compile Vim, you need a lot of things
before it works. When your setup is OK, Vim should compile with just one
warning (about an argument to signal()).

You will have to set the "VIM" environment variable to the location of the
documentation files.


4. Win32 (Windows NT and Windows 95)
====================================

Summary:
nmake -f Makefile.w32		Win32 SDK or Microsoft Visual C++
nmake -f Makefile.b32		Borland C++ 4.5
nmake -f vim.mak		Microsoft Visual C++

These files have been supplied by George V. Reilly and Ben Singer; they should
work.  Vim.mak isn't all that useful to most people (it doesn't build cmdtab.h
correctly, it doesn't handle dependencies correctly, and it doesn't
rebuild version.obj every time that vim is built), so unless you are
debugging Vim in the MSVC IDE, you should build with Makefile.w32 instead.
The Makefile.b32 has not been tested much, use Makefile.w32 if you can.

You will have to set the "VIM" environment variable to the location of the
documentation files.


5. Archimedes
=============

make -f makefile.arch

This probably doesn't work, since the include file archie.h is still missing.
Nobody is currently working on this.


6. Macintosh
============

Vim should work on the Macintosh, but I don't have a makefile for it.
Work is being done to update the Macintosh port.  It's a lot of work, don't
expect it soon.


7. Unix
=======

Summary:
1. make			run configure, compile and link
2. make install		installation in /usr/local

This will include the GUI and X11 libraries, if you have them.  If you want a
version of Vim that is small and starts up quickly, see the Makefile how to
disable the GUI and X11.  If you don't have Motif and/or X11 these features
will be disabled automatically.

See the start of Makefile for more detailed instructions about how to compile
Vim.

If you are compiling Vim for several machines, for each machine:
a.	make shadow
b.	mv shadow machine_name
c.	cd machine_name
d.	points 1 and 2 above

[don't use a path for machine_name, just a directory name, otherwise the links
that "make shadow" create won't work]

GNU Autoconf and a few other tools have been used to make Vim work on many
different Unix systems. The advantage of this is that Vim should compile
on most sytems without any adjustments. The disadvantage is that when
adjustments are required it takes some time to understand what is happening.

If configure finds all library files, and when linking it complains that some
of them can't be found, your linker doesn't return an error code for missing
libraries.  Vim would be linked fine anyway, just ignore these errors.

On Linux, when using -g to compile (which is default for gcc), the executable
will probably be statically linked.  If you don't want this, remove the -g
option from CFLAGS.

If you run configure by hand (not using the Makefile), remember that any
changes in the Makefile have no influence on configure.  This may be what you
want, but maybe not!


8. OS/2
=======

Summary:
ren makefile makefile.unix
ren makefile.os2 makefile
make

This alpha port of Vim to OS/2 is based on the emx environment together
with GNU C. The main design goal of emx is to simplify porting Unix
software to OS/2 and DOS. Because of this, almost all the Unix defines
etc. already existing in the Vim source code could be reused. Only where
OS/2 specifics came into play were additional changes necessary. Those
places can be found by searching for "OS2" and "__EMX__" (I've tried to
keep emx-specific things separate from generic OS/2 stuff).

Warning! Not tested well yet; report problems to paul@wau.mis.ah.nl
         (email valid up to at least August 1996). Take care with
         textmode / notextmode (notextmode will be silently converted
         to textmode (always!)), and binary mode (0% tested). Other
         problems are sure to exist as well, so keep an up to date
         copy of files you plan to edit with Vim!!!

Prerequisites:
- Make sure to use an HPFS partition for the sources! FAT partitions
  deserve to die.
- I've set some things up that expect the sources in
  c:/local/src/vim-3.24/src and Vim system .vimrc and help files in
  c:/local/lib/vim. If you want to change that, change patd_os2.c.
- To compile, you need the emx environment (at least rev. 0.9b), GCC,
  some make utility (GNU make works fine). These are generally
  available as (ask Archie about them):
    emxrt.zip     emx runtime package
    emxdev.zip    emx development system (without compiler)
  GNU programs compiled for emx, patches and patched sources:
    gnudev1.zip   GNU development tools compiled for emx (part 1)
    gnudev2.zip   GNU development tools compiled for emx (part 2)
    gnumake.zip   GNU make
- To run Vim, emx.dll should be available in one of the directories
  listed in your LIBPATH.
- Don't set a TERM environment variable; Vim defaults to os2ansi
  which is available as a builtin termcap entry. Using other values
  may give problems! (OS/2 ANSI emulation is quite limited.)

Check vim_os2.txt for additional info.


9. Atari MiNT
=============

The changes for Atari MiNT are not included in the distribution yet.  A
Makefile is also missing.  It is almost the same as the Unix stuff.
This will be made available later.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of this file is based on the INSTALL file that comes with GNU
autoconf 2.4. Not everything applies to Vim. Read Makefile too!


Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Or edit Makefile. There are examples lines with CC and CFLAGS that can be
used by removing the '#' in column one. Some are for generic use, with
debugger or optimizer. There are also lines for some specific systems.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
