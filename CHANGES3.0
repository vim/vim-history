This file contains an overview of changes from Vim version 2.0 to 3.0

The changes new in version 2.x are marked with (2.x).
Some changes from Robert Webb are marked with (Webb 2.5).

Big improvements
================

Added multiple windows and multiple buffers! See doc/windows.doc for an
overview of the new and changed commands.

Added hidden buffers. 'hidden' option can be set to create a hidden buffer
instead of abandoning a buffer. Added ":bnext", ":bprev", ":bNext" and
"brewind" commands to go to other buffer. Added ":buffers" command to show all
buffers. Added ":bmod" command: go to next modified buffer. Added ":bdelete"
command: delete buffer from list. (2.4)

Added a lot of commands to manipulate buffers:
- Added commands to open a window for all arguments, all active buffers, all
  buffers: ":all", ":sall", ":unhide", ":sunhide", ":ball", ":sball". (2.5)
- Added ":bunload" command: Unload buffer from memory. The ":bdelete" command
  does the same plus deletes the buffer from the buffer list. (2.5)
- Arguments from command line are always put in buffer list. (2.5)
- Added ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", ":sbNext", ":sbprevious", ":sbmodified",
  ":sbrewind", ":sblast": split window and go to specified buffer. (2.5)
- Added ":wNext" and ":wprevious": write file and go back in argument list.
  (2.5)
- Added ":wqall" and ":xall", write all change buffers and exit. (2.5)


When all changes have been undone the buffer is not considered to be changed.
Vim can then be exit with ":q" instead of ":q!".

Added simple "more" facility to listings. Can be switched on/off with the
'more' option.

Added Webb's code for command line completion, with "#ifdef WEBB_COMPLETE".
(Webb 2.5)


Changes incompatible with previous versions
===========================================

Command lines starting with '#' are no longer considered to be comments. '#'
is a synonym for :number.

Embedded newline characters in command lines are considered to be the end of a
command line. To use newline characters in a command, precede it with CTRL-V
(you have to type CTRL-V two times to get one).

The ":files" command is now the same as the ":buffers" command. The file list
and the buffer list have been integrated into one list. The buffer number and
the file number are equal and will not change during an editing session. (2.5)

":buffer" does not accept a file name but a buffer number. Use ":set hid" and
":e file". (2.5)

Made 'laststatus' a numeric option. It says when to use a status line for last
window: 0 is never, 1 if more than one window, 2 is always. (2.5)

Replaced CTRL-P in insert mode by CTRL-B (for Backwards). CTRL-P can now be
used for keyword completion. (2.5)

The search pattern for the :tag command does not replace the search pattern
that is remembered for the next search command. (Webb 2.5)

Use CTRL-X instead of CTRL-S (subtract). Do not switch off xon/xoff in unix.c.
Fixes problems with CTRL-S on some terminals. (2.4)

Using >> will not shift lines that start with '#' when 'si' is set. (Webb 2.5)

"\?" in expressions (match exactly one time) replaced by "\=", makes "?\?\?"
work.

The commands "*" and "#" only search for whole words, using "\<ident\>". (Webb
2.5)

When doing a ":ta" command after CTRL-T, the tag stack is truncated, rather
than keeping old tags at the top. Now repeating CTRL-T will get you back to
the first ":ta" and stop there. (Webb 2.5)

Made argument list global, not local to each window. ":quit" works when there
are more files to edit, except when there is only one window. (2.4)

The ".vim" file is not used for recovery with the "-r" argument. Use
"Vim -s file.vim file" instead.

First page of swap file has changed, cannot recover files from older versions.
The swap file can now be recognized by its start: "b0VIM 3.0", where 3.0 is
the version number. (3.0)


New commands and functionality
==============================

Added insert-mode keyword completion commands CTRL-P and CTRL-N inside #ifdef
WEBB_KEYWORD_COMPL. (Webb 2.5)

Updated error messages for keyword completion in insert mode. (2.7)

Added "]f" command: Edit file whose name is under the cursor. Added CTRL-W
CTRL-F and CTRL-W f: split window and edit file whose name is
under the cursor. (Webb 2.5)

Changed "]f" into "gf". Mnemonic: goto file. (2.7)

Put "]f" and "[f" back in, they do the same as "gf". For people that have the
'g' key remapped. (2.9)

Added CTRL-W CTRL-R, CTRL-W r, CTRL-W R: rotate windows upwards/downwards
(2.5)

Added CTRL-W CTRL-X and CTRL-W x: exchange current window with next one. (Webb
2.5)

Added window title for xterm.

Added termcap options 't_so' (standout) and 't_se' (standout end). Use 't_so'
and 't_se' if inversion is not possible and for highlighting directories.
At some places standout mode is used instead of inversion. (Webb 2.5)

Do wait_return() message and the message used when asked for 'y' or 'n' is now
in standout mode. (Webb 2.5)

Added termcap option 't_ms' (save to move cursor in reverse mode). Makes
inversion work on some terminals.

Added ":mode" command. Under Amiga and Unix this only re-sets the screen
size. With MSDOS it is possible to switch screen mode.

Now also "%<", "#31<", alternate file name without extension.

Added ':' register. Contains last command line. "@:" repeats last command
line.

Added ":exit" as synonym for ":xit". More logical, isn't it?

Added ":swapname". Show swap file name for current buffer.

":args" can have arguments for redefining the argument list, just like
":next". (2.5)

When the command for the tag is a search and it fails, try searching for the
tag itself with pattern "^tag(" and "^[#a-zA-Z_].*tag(". (Webb 2.5)

"%" will now go to matching comment delimiters (/ *, * /) and find matches for
the preprocessing lines #ifdef, #else, #elif and #endif. (Webb 2.5)

Using '%' on #if/#else/#endif makes the movement linewise. (2.7)

"[p", "[P", "]p" and "]P" work like "p" and "P" but adjust the indent of the
putted lines to match the context. (Webb 2.5)

Changed put indented: "[p" and "]p" is "]p" (put forward), "[P" and "]P" is
"[p" (put backward). (2.7)

"[(" and "[{" may be used to go to the (count'th) last unclosed ( or {.
"])" and "]}" may be used to jump to the (count'th) next unopen) or }. Can be
used to jump to the start/end of the innermost c-code block (Webb 2.5)

Added count to ":", "count:" translates into ":.,.+(count - 1)". (Webb 2.5)

Added ":sleep" command. (2.4)

"g" is to be used for a new series of commands. First one: "gs" sleeps for a
moment (Mnemonic: Go to Sleep). Give count for that many seconds. Can be
interrupted with CTRL-C. (2.5)

Added ":last" and ":slast", go to last argument. (2.5)
Added ":argument [N]" and ":sargument [N]", go to Nth argument. (2.5)
Added ":blast" and ":sblast", go to last buffer. (2.5)

Added "-o[N]" command line argument: Open N windows on startup. (2.5)

Added ":only", CTRL-W CTRL-O, CTRL-O o: Close all but current window. (2.5)

Added default digraph: <space> <char> is meta-char. (2.4)

Digraphs with CTRL-H do not make meta characters. Use CTRL-K <space>
<char>. Fixes problem with abbreviations when 'digraph' set. (2.5)

Don't allow digraphs with ESC. Hitting ESC in digraph exits insert mode. (2.5)

Added ":snext", ":sNext", ":sprev" and ":srewind" commands, split window and
go to next/previous file in argument list. (2.4)

Added CTRL-W CTRL-P and CTRL-W p, jump to previous window. (2.4)

Added "zz", "zt" and "zb", same as "z.", "zCR" and "z-" but without moving the
cursor to the start of the line. (2.4)

":bdelete" and ":bunload" accept a range of buffers and a list of buffer
numbers. (2.7)


Improvements
============

Cursor up/down in insert mode keep the same column. Also for "CTRL-O j" and
the like.

Added column number to :file.

Improved listing of ":set" command. The columns are now sorted top to bottom.
Long string options are listed at the end (idea comes from nvi).

Renamed directory "macros" to "tools". Moved doc/vim132 to tools/vim132.

"ref" program added for "K" command (in the tools directory. Does simple
spelling check.

Vim arguments "-c command" and "+command" are now options that can be given
anywhere on the command line before the file names. Makes it possible to do
"Vim "+set ic" -t FuncTion".

Improved Usage message.

Added check for negative line numbers in colon commands.

Removed 'n' offset to search patterns. Avoiding pcmark set is now down with
tag_busy flag.

Improved error messages for file access.

":args" does not call wait_return() when message is short.

When doing :paste twice the option values are saved only once.

Accept '\n' to separate Ex commands, just like '|'.

With search also accept 'b' for begin, like 's' for start.
When 'e' used the operator is inclusive.

Visual shift accepts a count for number of indents.

No "hit return to continue" while filtering and only once when reading/writing
files.

For Amiga and MSDOS lines longer than 32000 characters are split when reading.
Used to give problems (out of memory errors).

When ':' entered after "hit return to continue" don't redraw the screen.

In regexp: made '$' in front of '\|' also end-of-line.

Added "+command" argument to ":next", ":prev", ":rewind" and ":Next".

Give better error message when "/" did not found pattern and 'wrapscan' off.

Added message "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" when search wraps. Don't
display this message when 'terse' option is on.

Made ":&" work like ":s//~/".

Consider mapped characters for terminal codes, makes "map <key-code1>
<key-code2>" work.

Remember two search patterns: One for substitute and one for the rest. This is
how vi works. ":global" command sets both patterns.

Error messages during global command are listed below each other. (2.4)

Don't redisplay the "INSERT" message when getting out of insert mode.

With escape in insert mode and auto-indent the cursor is put in the correct
column right away instead of after one second.

Added "Permission denied" message to readfile().

Added preserve command. Writes all text into the swap file.

Named marks are saved for undo, restored for redo.

Reduced terminal I/O by using screen_char() instead of outchar() for messages.

Added count to quickfix commands :cn and :cp. :cl and :cf can be interrupted
by CTRL-C.

For MSDOS ignore CTRL-Z at end of file in textmode.

No mapping for CR when waiting for "hit return to continue".

Use 'ignorecase' option when searching for tag in tag file.

When count given for undo or redo, redraw screen only once.

Clear message on command line when scrolling, otherwise it will stay there
until the screen is cleared. (2.5)

Marks are remembered for buffers that are unloaded. (2.5)

Implemented scroll regions, using "CS" termcap entry. Also works for pc
console. Does not work for Amiga. (2.5)

Made searches starting with "\<" quite a bit faster, by using regmust in
regexp.c. (2.5)

Don't output an extra line when reading a file and screen has been scrolled up
(e.g. after CTRL-D). (2.5)

After "dG" "''" still works (when previous context mark is deleted, use
previous one). (2.5)

A count can be given after an ex command for all commands that do not use a
line number or range, e.g. ":sleep 2" is the same as :2sleep". Do not accept a
count where a file name is expected, because file names can be numbers. For
example ":next 4". (2.5)

"~/" is expanded to $HOME, wherever an environment variable is allowed. (2.5)

When the start of a filename matches $HOME, it is replaced with "~/" for the
window title, status line, message from ":read", ":write", CTRL-G, ":file",
":marks" and ":jumps". Also for string options shown with ":set" that can be a
file name. (2.5)

Previous context mark for each window instead of for each buffer. (Webb 2.5)

Set previous context mark only if line number changed. (Webb 2.5)

Made tagstack local to each window. (Webb 2.5)

In the status line of a modified buffer "[+]" is shown. (Webb 2.5)

Remember cursor position in tag stack for :tag command without argument. (Webb
2.5)

When backwards range given for ":" command, ask for confirmation to swap it
and continue. (Webb 2.5)

After CTRL-T set curswant, so we stay in that column when moving up/down.
(Webb 2.5)

With :s/../../c show ruler when waiting for reply. (Webb 2.5)

Give file name message for commands ":bnext", ":bmod" and the like. (2.5)

Made index in argument list local to each window. (2.5)

Show visual selection only in current window. (2.5)

When a window is split, redraw both windows with cursor in middle. (2.4)

Included code to save the xterm title. Need to define USE_X11, because
specific include file and library are needed. (2.4)

Made "search hit BOT.." messages redisplay after screen redraw. (2.4)

Don't do textwidth formatting when in replace mode and replacing an existing
character. (2.4)

Print message about the file when starting to edit an existing buffer. Fixes
not giving a message when doing ":n" to file being edited in other window.
(2.4)

When lines are deleted/inserted, adjust topline and cursor position of other
windows on same buffer to stay in the same place (if possible). (2.4)

If CTRL-W CTRL-] is done on a tag that does not exist, the window is not
split. (2.4)

Moved column number in CTRL-G to the end and adjusted the number. (2.4)

Added "-- more --" message to listing of mappings. (2.4)

Accept 'q' with "-- more --" message. Interrupts current listing. (2.4)

When end of Visual area is on an empty line, minlc is FALSE, makes
"d}P" and "v}dP" do the same. (2.4)

When the commands '*' and '#' do not find an identifier after the cursor, a
search is done for a non-identifier string. (2.5)

Made the ":buffers" listing nicer by putting the "line" string in column 40.
(2.7)

Updated error messages for keyword completion. (2.8)

If 'winheight' set spread extra lines over other windows. (2.8)

When 'updatecount' changed from zero to non-zero, create swap file for all
loaded buffers. (2.8)

When command line completion found more than one match, beep. (3.0)

Changed "still more files to edit" into "6 more files to edit". (2.9)

When :bdel is used with a range and errors occur, still delete the other
buffers. (3.0)

Added version string to .swp file. (3.0)

In MSDOS version: After calling a shell, check screen size. Now it is possible
to set the screen size with a command like ":!setmode xxx". (3.0)

Don't try to open an X11 display if WINDOWID is not set, makes startup a bit
quicker sometimes. (3.0)


New and changed options
=======================

Default 'updatetime' is 10000, 10sec. Default 'updatecount' is 1000. This
feels more comfortable. But if you keep on typing, more will be lost when
crashing.

Changed default for 'updatecount' to 200 (1000 was too much). Default for
'updatetime' is now four seconds (more than three seconds means that your
attention is drawn away). (2.7)

Added 'cmdheight' option ('ch'), number of lines for command line. Set it to 2
or 3 if you are annoyed by "hit return to continue" questions for long
messages.

Added 'winheight' option ('wh'), number of lines for active window. Set it to
999 to make the current window always fill the screen.

Made 'winheight' option a "minimal window height" option, only set height if
current height is smaller. (2.4)

Added 'laststatus' option ('ls'). When set to 2 last window always has a
status line. When set to 1 (which is the default) the last window only has a
status line if there are two or more windows. When set to 0 there is never a
status line. The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
windows, but takes another screen line.

Added optional '>' to 'directory' and 'backupdir' option, e.g. ">/tmp". When
used, 'directory' option is always used for swap file. When not used
'directory' is only used when swap file cannot be created in current
directory. The default is that the swap file will be in the current directory
when possible, in 'directory' otherwise. 'directory' defaults to "/tmp" for
unix, "t:" for Amiga and "c:\tmp" for MSDOS. The 'backupdir' option works in
the same way, but is currently only available for Unix.

Added 'nobuf' option ('nb'). When set one character is send to the terminal
at a time (does not work for MSDOS). For debugging purposes.

Added 'shellpipe' option ('sp'). String to use for the make command to store
the error messages. For Amiga and MSDOS it defaults to ">". For Unix it
defaults to "| tee". For "csh", "tcsh" and "zsh" it is changed into "|& tee".
For "sh", "ksh" and "bash" it is changed into "2>&1| tee". Fixes problem with
:make when not using csh.

Added 'maxmem' option ('mm'), maximal Kbyte to use for one buffer.

Added 'smarttab' option ('sta'). When set a TAB in front of a line inserts
'shiftwidth' positions, 'tabstop' in other places. When not set a TAB always
inserts 'tabstop' positions, 'shiftwidth' is only used for ">>" and the like.

Added 'maxmemtot' option ('mmt'), maximal Kbyte to use for all buffers.

Added 'ttyfast' option ('tf'). When set the terminal is assumed to be fast,
scrolling windows is done by redrawing. When not set windows are scrolled with
insert/delete line commands, causing the windows below it to jump up and down
if threre is no support for a scrolling region.

Added 'equalalways' option: When windows split or closed, always do CTRL-W =.
(2.5)

Added 'splitbelow': When set new window from split is below current one. (2.5)

Added 'tagrelative' option (default ON!). When using tag file in other
directory, file names are relative to the directory where the tag file is.
(Webb 2.5)

When setting 'winheight' adjust current window straight away. Check for
negative value. (Webb 2.5)

Added 'gdefault' option: make /g default for :s command (default off). (2.4)

Added 'title' option (default on). When off, window title is not set. (2.4)

Added NOTITLE compile time option for Vera: When defined the title option is
default off. (2.7)

Added 'icon' option (default off): when set xterm icon is set to file name.
(2.4)

Added 'invertweird' option, for terminals that have a weird inversion method.
Makes the start/end invert code outputted before every character. (2.4)

Changed 'invertweird' to 'weirdinvert', because an option starting with 'inv'
is illegal. ":set invertweird" gives an error message. (2.7)

Added 'endofline' 'eol' option. If not set and in binary mode, last line will
not get an end of line when writing. (2.4)

Added 'bswrap' option: Backspace (CTRL-H) and space wrap to previous/next line
in command mode. Default is ON! Should have been added long ago! (2.4)

When 'bswrap' option set, left/right cursor keys in insert mode also wrap to
previous/next line. (2.7)

Changed toggle 'bswrap' option to number 'whichwrap' option: Add numbers to
allow specific keys to wrap to next/previous line: 1 for backspace, 2 for
space, 4 for 'h' and 'l', 8 for cursor left/right, 16 for cursor left/right in
insert mode. (2.7)

Added 'patchmode' option. Oldest version of a file is kept. (2.4)

Added 't_csc' termcap option: when set (to anything) the cursor positioning is
done relative to the start of the scrolling region. Otherwise it is relative
to the start of the screen. Unfortunately there is no termcap entry for this.
We are just guessing its value. Currently only MSDOS pcterm is know to need
this set. This fixes doing 'o' not getting the new line in the right place for
MSDOS. (2.7)

Added 'highlight' ('hl') option: Can set highlighting mode for various
occasions. 'i' for invert, 'b' for bold, 's' for standout; 'v' = visual mode,
'd' = directories in CTRL-D listing, 'e' = error messages, 's' = status lines,
'h' = help file headers, 'r' = return to continue message. They have to be
given in pairs, separated with a comma. For example:
":set hl=ds,vb,ei,si,hb,ri". Invert is used for occasions that are not
included. Default is "ds,es,hs,rs,vi,si". (2.6)

Changed the default highlight mode for directories to bold. (2.7)

Added 'n' to 'highlight' option: no highlighting. (2.7)

Added 'bold' termcap option as t_tb. (2.6)


Vi compatibility fixes
======================

":>", ":<" and ":yank" leave cursor on the last line.

Abbreviations recognized like vi, fixes abbreviation of "#i" to "#include".

"d]]" also stops at '{'.

']' and '[' are not linewise.

"z." and "z-" move cursor to start of line. "zz" does the same as "z.".

":>>" shifts two indents, ":>>>" three, etc.

When no file name yet and giving a ":read fname" command, use that file name.
(2.4) When no file name yet and giving a ":write fname" command, use that file
name. (2.5)

":3,3join" does nothing, fixes "g/^$/.,/./-j" to delete only multiple empty
lines. (2.5)

":wnext" does not go to next file in argument list if write fails. (2.5)

CTRL-W CURSOR-UP and CTRL-W CURSOR-DOWN do the same as CTRL-W k and CTRL-W j.
(2.5)

'smartindent' is improved: When '}' is typed as the first char on a line,
it is moved to line up with the line containing the matching '{' (rather than
just moving back one shift-width no matter what).  If '#' is the first
character typed on a line, then the line is moved all the way to the left.
(Webb 2.5)

When 'smartindent' set, '#' removes all indent. Now the existing indent is
remembered for the next line (like with ^ CTRL-D). (2.7)

When ESC is used to cancel a command, don't beep. (Webb 2.5)

When 'autoindent' set and inserting a CR, delete white space after the cursor.
(Webb 2.5)

Don't set curswant when 'h' or 'l' fails. (Webb 2.5)

With "70|" command set curswant to 70, also when line is shorter. (Webb 2.5)

Fixed "cc" to delete the text linewise, but keep the indent when 'ai' is set.
(2.5)

"dTx" and "dFx" do not include cursor position.

":r" without a file name specified reads current file.

"ce" when on the end of a word changes until the end of the next word
(but "cw" not).

After "dd" put cursor on first non-blank in line.

Abbreviations are never recursive, makes ":ab f f-o" work.

'#' is not the start of an ex comment but an abbreviation for ":number".

Put redo for "p" and "P" back in. It is not completely compatible, because vi
doesn't always redo putting less then a line (but that is considered to be a
bug in vi). (2.5)

Adjusted comp_col() for when 'laststatus' is set. Reduces need for "hit return
to continue". (2.5)

With ":global" command, don't display "n more lines" messages until the end.
(2.5)

Don't reset yank buffer with "." command. Makes dwu"a. work. (2.4)

Don't check for abbreviation when a (non-id) character is entered with CTRL-V.
(2.4)

With change command put deleted text in "1, even with text within one line.
(2.4)

When deleting and a register is specified, also yank into buffer "1. (2.4)

":3|" prints line 3 instead of jumping to it. (2.4)

Separated 'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth'. Both can be used, if textwidth is set
it overrides 'wrapmargin'. (2.8)


Bug fixes
=========

Fixed problem in memmove for __sgi.

Fixed ":cd" not working for unix.

Made incrementing hex numbers with CTRL-A work on systems that don't accept 0x
in scanf for "%x".

Reset p_ro in readfile() when starting to edit a new file.

Fixed CTRL-O in insert mode moving cursor when it is after end of line.

Vertical movement in insert mode can put cursor one char after the line.

Fixed not inverting 0xa0 in visual mode when scrolling. This caused gaps in
the inverted region.

Fixed hangup for "?$" command.

Fixed keyword macros: ^B must be ^R.

":set all" and ":set termcap" do not look for other arguments.

{count}% puts cursor on first non-blank.

When ":ta" to tag in same file, start search in line 1. Fixes problem when
'wrapscan' is not set.

Fixed setting of pcmark for "(" and ")".

Fixed setting pcmark with :e command.

Fixed a crash on Unix when terminal type unknown. (2.5)

Fixed 'showmatch', the cursor was off. (2.5)

Solved crash when 'lines' was set in .exrc. (2.5)

Fixed memory leak for mf_xfname. (2.5)

Fixed a problem in the Unix part for making backup files. Strange that this
did not cause the compiler to complain. (2.5)

Filename expansion is now done into NameBuff instead of IObuff. Fixes bugs
where file name was scrambled or Vim crashed some time after ":next file".
(2.5)

Fixed deleting the file message when 't_tp' was set in .vimrc. (2.5)

Fixed cursor positioning problem when :s/../../gc made line go past end of

When the 'hidden' option is set don't give error message for changed file on
several commands (:ta). (2.5)

Update timestamp in swap file when the file has been written. (2.5)

Fixed a problem not updating the time stamp in the swap file when writing
another but the current buffer. (2.7)

Fixed bug: not-edited file could be written with ":w". (2.5)

Fixed invering Visual part when 'nowrap' set and start is left of window.
(2.4)

Fixed problem with join: Deleted leading spaces in the 2nd line when it
shouldn't. (2.4)

Internals
=========

Renamed u_char to char_u, u_short to short_u. Avoids problems with systems
where these are already defined.

Replaced almost all char by char_u, solves some problems with characters above
127.

Removed ptr2nr(). This means that line numbers are adjusted when
inserting/deleting lines. Marks remember line number instead of pointer; undo
uses line count to compute ue_bot.

Moved all objects files into "obj" directory.

Added "window.c" for multiple window code.

Added "memfile.c" and "memline.c" for swap file code.

Moved what was remaining of "storage.c" to "undo.c", deleted "storage.c".

Deleted autoscript file stuff.

Renamed "buffers.c" to "getchar.c".

Created "buffer.c". Deleted "script.c".

Moved a few functions from "cmdline.c" to "cmdcmds.c" to reduce the size of
"cmdline.c".

Integrated file list into buffer list. ":buffers" and ":files" do the same.
Moved functions from "filelist.c" to "buffer.c", deleted "filelist.c". (2.5)

Remove mch_start_listing() and mch_stop_listing(), replaced by "--more--".
(2.5)


Portability
===========

A few patches, the file "winnt.c" and "makefile.nt" for windows NT. (2.4)

Added support for Archimedes. It probably doesn't work, because "archie.h" was
missing, and the patches are for Vim version 2.0. Included them anyway, so
people can make patches to make it working. (2.9)

Added a few changes for USL in unix.c.

Made makefile for unix more easy to change for a specific system.

Included small patches for gcc on HPUX 9. (2.4)

Set the SIGWINCH signal, when receiving that signal, for all systems. (Webb
2.5)

Changed Visual into VIsual, because it is also used by X11. (2.4)

Added some changes for USL and picky gcc. (2.4)

Included patches for SCO 3.2. (2.4)

Removed the use of the 'obj' directory from makefile.unix. Some versions of
make and cc were having problems with it. (2.7)
