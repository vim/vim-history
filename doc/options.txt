Vim has a number of internal variables and switches which can be set to
achieve special effects.  These options come in three forms:
	toggle		can only be on or off		*toggle*
	number		has a numeric value
	string		has a string value

==============================================================================
1. Setting options					*set-option*

							*:se* *:set*
:se[t]			Show all options that differ from their default value.

:se[t] all		Show all but terminal options.

:se[t] termcap		Show all terminal options.

:se[t] {option}?	Show value of {option}.

:se[t] {option}		Toggle option: set, switch it on.
			Number option: show value.
			String option: show value.

:se[t] no{option}	Toggle option: Reset, switch it off.

:se[t] {option}!   or
:se[t] inv{option}	Toggle option: Invert value.  {not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}&	Reset option to its default value.  {not in Vi}

:se[t] all&		Set all options, except terminal options, to their
			default value.  The values of 'term', 'lines' and
			'columns' are not changed  {not in Vi}

:se[t] {option}={value}		or
:se[t] {option}:{value}
			Set string or number option to {value}.  For numeric
			options the value can be given in decimal, hex
			(preceded with 0x) or octal (preceded with '0')
			(hex and octal are only available for machines which
			have the strtol() function).  The old value can be
			inserted by typing <Tab> (or whatever the value of
			'wildchar' is).  See |cmdline-completion|.
			See |option-backslash| for using backslashes in
			{value}.

							*:fix* *:fixdel*
:fix[del]		Set the value of 't_kD':
				't_kb' is     't_kD' becomes	~
				  CTRL-?	CTRL-H
				not CTRL-?	CTRL-?

			(CTRL-? is 0177 octal, 0x7f hex) {not in Vi}

			If your delete key terminal code is wrong, but the
			code for backspace is allright, you can put this in
			your .vimrc:
>				:fixdel
			This works no matter what the actual code for
			backspace is.

			If the backspace key terminal code is wrong you can
			use this:
>				:if &term == "termname"
>				:  set t_kb=^V<BS>
>				:  fixdel
>				:endif
			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<BS>" is the backspace key
			(don't type four characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

			If your <Delete> key sends a strange key sequence (not
			CTRL-? or CTRL-H) you cannot use ":fixdel".  Then use:
>				:if &term == "termname"
>				:  set t_kD=^V<Delete>
>				:endif
			Where "^V" is CTRL-V and "<Delete>" is the delete key
			(don't type eight characters!).  Replace "termname"
			with your terminal name.

			Note about Linux: By default the backspace key
			produces CTRL-?, which is wrong.  You can fix it by
			putting this line in your rc.local:
>				echo "keycode 14 = BackSpace" | loadkeys

The {option} arguments to ":set" may be repeated.  For example:
>  :set ai nosi sw=3 ts=3
If you make an error in one of the arguments an error message will be given
and the text up to the next space will be skipped.  Thus following arguments
will be processed.

For {option} the form "t_xx" may be used to set a termcap option.  This will
override the value from the termcap.  You can then use it in a mapping.  If
the "xx" part contains special characters, use the <t_xx> form:
	:set <t_#4>=^[Ot

The listing from ":set" looks different from Vi.  Long string options are put
at the end of the list.  The number of options is quite large.  The output of
"set all" probably does not fit on the screen, causing Vim to give the
|more-prompt|.

			   *:set_env* *expand-env* *expand-environment-var*
Environment variables in most string options will be expanded.  If the
environment variable exists the '$' and the following environment variable
name is replaced with its value.  If it does not exist the '$' and the name
are not modified.  Any non-id character (not a letter, digit or '_') may
follow the environment variable name.  That character and what follows is
appended to the value of the environment variable.  Examples:
>  :set term=$TERM.new
>  :set path=/usr/$INCLUDE,$HOME/include,.

								*$HOME*
Using "~" is like using "$HOME", but it is only recognized at the start of an
option and after a space or comma.

On Unix systems "~user" can be used too.  It is replaced by the home directory
of user "user".  Example:
>   :set path=~mool/include,/usr/include,.

On Unix systems the form "${HOME}" can be used too.  The name between {} can
contain non-id characters then.  Note that if you want to use this for the
"gf" command, you need to add the '{' and '}' characters to 'isfname'.

								*$VIM*
The environment variable "$VIM" is used to locate various support files, such
as the on-line documentation and files used for syntax highlighting.  For
example, the main help file is normally "$VIM/doc/help.txt".

To avoid the need for every user to set the $VIM environment variable, Vim
will try to get the value for $VIM in this order:
1. The value defined by the $VIM environment variable.  You can use this to
   make Vim look in a specific directory for its support files.  Example:
>	setenv VIM /home/paul/vim
2. For MSDOS and Win32 the environment variable $HOME is used, when defined.
   Works just like setting the $VIM environment variable.
3. The path from 'helpfile' is used, unless it contains some environment
   variable too (the default is "$VIM/doc/help.txt": chicken-egg problem).
   The file name ("help.txt" or any other) is removed.  If it then ends in
   "/doc", this is removed too.
4. For MSDOS, Win32 and OS/2 Vim tries to use the directory name of the
   executable.  If it ends in "/src", this is removed.  This is useful if you
   unpacked the .zip file in some directory, and adjusted the search path to
   find the vim executable.
5. For Unix the compile-time defined installation directory is used (see the
   output of ":version").

Note the maximum length of an expanded option is limited.  How much depends on
the system, mostly it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.

							*option-backslash*
To include white space in a string option value it has to be preceded with a
backslash.  To include a backslash you have to use two.  Effectively this
means that the number of backslashes in an option value is halved (rounded
down).
A few examples:
>  :set tags=tags\ /usr/tags	    results in "tags /usr/tags"
>  :set tags=tags\\,file	    results in "tags\,file"
>  :set tags=tags\\\ file	    results in "tags\ file"

For MS-DOS and WIN32 backslashes in file names are mostly not removed.  More
precise: For options that expect a file name (those where environment
variables are expanded) a backslash before a normal file name character is not
removed.  But a backslash before a special character (space, backslash, comma,
etc.) is used like explained above.

==============================================================================
2. Automatically setting options			*auto-setting*

Besides changing options with the ":set" command, there are three alternatives
to set options automatically for one or more files:

1. When starting Vim initializations are read from various places.  See
   |initialization|.  Most of them are performed for all editing sessions,
   and some of them depend on the directory where Vim is started.
2. If you start editing a new file, the automatic commands are executed.
   This can be used to set options for files matching a particular pattern and
   many other things.  See |autocommand|.
3. If you start editing a new file, and the 'modeline' option is on, a
   number of lines at the beginning and end of the file are checked for
   modelines.  This is explained here.

							*modeline*
There are two forms of modelines.  The first form:
	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]{options}

[text]		any text or empty
{white}		at least one white space (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|ex:}	the string "vi:", "vim:" or "ex:"
[white]		optional white space
{options}	a list of option settings, separated with white space or ':',
		where each part between ':' is the argument for a ":set"
		command

Example:
>  vi:noai:sw=3 ts=6

The second form (this is compatible with some versions of Vi):

	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]set {options}:[text]

[text]		any text or empty
{white}		at least one white space (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|ex:}	the string "vi:", "vim:" or "ex:"
[white]		optional white space
set 		the string "set " (note the space)
{options}	a list of options, separated with white space, which is the
		argument for a ":set" command
:		a colon
[text]		any text or empty

Example:
>  /* vim: set ai tw=75: */

The white space before {vi:|vim:|ex:} is required.  This minimizes the chance
that a normal word like "lex:" is caught.  There is one exception: "vi:" and
"vim:" can also be at the start of the line (for compatibility with version
3.0).  Using "ex:" at the start of the line will be ignored (this could be
short for "example:").

The number of lines that are checked can be set with the 'modelines' option.
If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is 0 no lines are checked.

Note that for the first form all of the rest of the line is used, thus a line
like:
>  /* vi:ts=4: */
will give an error message for the trailing "*/".  This line is OK:
>  /* vi:set ts=4: */

If an error is detected the rest of the line is skipped.

If you want to include a ':' in a set command precede it with a '\'.  No other
commands than "set" are supported, for security reasons (somebody might create
a trojan horse text file with modelines).

==============================================================================
3. Saving settings					*save-settings*

							*:mk* *:mkexrc*
:mk[exrc] [file]	Write current key mappings and changed options to
			[file] (default ".exrc" in the current directory),
			unless it already exists.  {not in Vi}

:mk[exrc]! [file]	Always write current key mappings and changed
			options to [file] (default ".exrc" in the current
			directory).  {not in Vi}

							*:mkv* *:mkvimrc*
:mkv[imrc][!] [file]	Like as :mkexrc, but default is ".vimrc" in the
			current directory.  The ":version" command is also
			written to the file.  {not in Vi}

These commands will write ":map" and ":set" commands to a file, in such a way
that when these commands are executed, the current key mappings and options
will be set to the same values.  The options 'columns', 'endofline', 'lines',
'modified', 'scroll', 'term' and 'ttyfast' are not included, because these are
terminal or file dependent.  Note that the options 'binary', 'fileformat',
'paste' and 'readonly' are included, this might not always be what you want.

A common method is to use a default ".vimrc" file, make some modifications
with ":map" and ":set" commands and write the modified file.  First read the
default ".vimrc" in with a command like ":source ~piet/.vimrc.Cprogs", change
the settings and then save them in the current directory with ":mkvimrc!".  If
you want to make this file your default .vimrc, move it to your home directory
(on Unix), s: (Amiga) or $VIM directory (MS-DOS).  You could also use
autocommands |autocommand| and/or modelines |modeline|.

If you only want to add a single option setting to your vimrc, you can use
these steps:
1. Edit your vimrc file with Vim.
2. Play with the option until it's right.  E.g., try out different values for
   'guifont'.
3. Append a line to set the value of the option, using the expression register
   '=' to enter the value.  E.g., for the 'guifont' option:
>  o:set guifont=<C-R>=&guifont<CR><Esc>
   [<C-R> is a CTRL-R, <CR> is a return, <Esc> is the escape key]

Note that when you create a .vimrc file, this can influence the 'compatible'
option, which has several side effects.  See |'compatible'|.

==============================================================================
4. Options summary					*option-summary*

In the list below all the options are mentioned with their full name and with
an abbreviation if there is one.  Both forms may be used.  In this document
when an option that can be toggled is "set" that means that ":set option" is
entered.  When an option is "reset", ":set nooption" is used.

For some options there are two default values: The "Vim default", which is
used when 'compatible' is not set, and the "Vi default", which is used when
'compatible' is set.

Most options are the same in all windows and buffers.  There are a few that
are specific to how the text is presented in a window.  These can be set to a
different value in each window.  For example the 'list' option can be set in
one window and reset in another for the same text, giving both types of view
at the same time.  There are a few options that are specific to a certain
file.  These can have a different value for each file or buffer.  For example
the 'textwidth' option can be 78 for a normal text file and 0 for a C
program.

	global			one option for all buffers and windows
	local to window		each window has its own copy of this option
	local to buffer		each buffer has its own copy of this option

When creating a new window the option values from the currently active window
are used as a default value for the window-specific options.  For the
buffer-specific options this depends on the 's' and 'S' flags in the
'cpoptions' option.  If 's' in included (which is the default) the values for
buffer options are copied from the currently active buffer when a buffer is
first entered.  If 'S' is present the options are copied each time the buffer
is entered, this is almost like having global options.  If 's' and 'S' are not
present, the options are copied from the currently active buffer when the
buffer is created.

A jump table for the options with a short description can be found at |X_op|.

					*'aleph'* *'al'*
'aleph' 'al'		number  (default 128 for MS-DOS, 224 otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	The ASCII code for the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The
	routine that maps the keyboard in Hebrew mode, both in Insert mode
	(when hkmap is set) and on the command line (when hitting CTRL-_)
	outputs the Hebrew characters in the range [aleph..aleph+26].
	aleph=128 applies to PC code, and aleph=224 applies to ISO 8859-8.
	See |rightleft.txt|.

			 *'altkeymap'* *'akm'* *'noalkeymap'* *'noakm'*
'altkeymap' 'akm'	toggle  (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+farsi|
			feature}
	When on, the second language is Farsi. In editing mode CTRL-_ toggles
	the keyboard map between Farsi and English.

	When off, the keyboard map toggles between Hebrew and English. This
	is useful to start the vim in native mode i.e. English (left-to-right
	mode) and have default second language Farsi or Hebrew (right-to-left
	mode).  See |farsi.txt|.

			       *'autoindent'* *'ai'* *'noautoindent'* *'noai'*
'autoindent' 'ai'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
	type anything on the new line except <BS> and then type <Esc> or
	<CR>, the indent is deleted again.  When autoindent is on,
	formatting (with the "gq" command or when you reach 'textwidth' in
	Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first line.   When
	'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on the indent is changed in specific
	cases.  The 'autoindent' option is reset when the 'paste' option is
	set.  {small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when
	typing <Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is
	after the deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted
	indent}.

				 *'autowrite'* *'aw'* *'noautowrite'* *'noaw'*
'autowrite' 'aw'	toggle	(default off)
			global
	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
	:next, :rewind, :previous, :stop, :suspend, :tag, :!, :make, CTRL-]
	and CTRL-^ command; and when a CTRL-O, CTRL-I, '<A-Z0-9>, or `<A-Z0-9>
	command takes one to another file.

							*'background'* *'bg'*
'background' 'bg'	string	(default "dark" or "light")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set to "dark", Vim will try to use colors that look good on a
	dark background.  When set to "light", Vim will try to use colors that
	look good on a light background.  Any other value is illegal.
	Vim tries to set the default value according to the terminal used.
	This will not always be correct.
	When starting the GUI, the default value for 'background' will be
	"light".  When the value is not set in the .gvimrc, and Vim detects
	that the background is actually quite dark, 'background' is set to
	"dark".  But this happens only after the .gvimrc file has been read
	(because the window needs to be opened to find the actual background
	color).
	For the Win32 GUI, setting 'background' before starting the GUI, will
	change the background and foreground colors to lightgrey on black or
	black on white.  On other systems setting 'background' does not
	change the foreground or background colors.
	Normally this option would be set in the .vimrc file.  Possibly
	depending on the terminal name.  Example:
>		if &term == "pcterm"
>		  set background=dark
>		endif
	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
	the setting of the 'background' option.
	This option is also used in the "$VIM/syntax/syntax.vim" file to set
	the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this option, you
	must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be done with
	":syntax on".

							*'backspace'* *'bs'*
'backspace' 'bs'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
	mode:
	value	effect  ~
	  0	Vi compatible backspacing is used.
	  1	allow backspacing over <EOL>s.
	  2	allow backspacing over the start of insert.  CTRL-W and CTRL-U
		stop once at the start of insert.
	See |:fixdel| if your <BS> or <Del> key does not do what you want.

				       *'backup'* *'bk'* *'nobackup'* *'nobk'*
'backup' 'bk'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
	written, reset this option and set the 'writebackup' option (this is
	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
	|backup-table| for more explanations.

						*'backupdir'* *'bdir'*
'backupdir' 'bdir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,c:/tmp,c:/temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,~/")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
	  where this is possible.
	- Empty means that no backup file will be created ('patchmode' is
	  impossible!).
	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
	  as the edited file.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et.al.) means to
	  put the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The
	  leading "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example:
>	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.

						*'backupext'* *'bex'*
'backupext' 'bex'	string	(default "~")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
	accidently overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
	".bak" that you want to keep.

				     *'binary'* *'bin'* *'nobinary'* *'nobin'*
'binary' 'bin'		toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
	use the "-b" Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
		'textwidth'  will be set to 0
		'wrapmargin' will be set to 0
		'modeline'   will be off
		'expandtab'  will be off
	Also, 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options will not be used, the
	file is read and written like 'fileformat' was "unix" (a single <NL>
	separates lines).
	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is
	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
	'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
	'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
	'bin' is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
	saved option values.
	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
	the 'endofline' option.

			       *'bioskey'* *'biosk'* *'nobioskey'* *'nobiosk'*
'bioskey' 'biosk'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {Only for MS-DOS}
	When on the bios is called to obtain a keyboard character.  This works
	better to detect CTRL-C, but only works for the console.  When using a
	terminal over a serial port reset this option.

						*'breakat'* *'brk'*
'breakat' 'brk'		string	(default " ^I!@*-+_;:,./?")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
	break if 'linebreak' is on.

				   *'cindent'* *'cin'* *'nocindent'* *'nocin'*
'cindent' 'cin'		toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	Enables automatic C program indenting  See 'cinkeys' to set the keys
	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and 'cinoptions' to set your
	preferred indent style.  If 'lisp' is not on and 'equalprg' is empty,
	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
	external program.  See |C-indenting|.  This option is switched off
	when 'paste' is set.  When you don't like the way 'cindent' works, try
	the 'smartindent' option.

'cinkeys' 'cink'	string	(default "0{,0},:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	A list of keys that, when typed in insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only happens if 'cindent' is on.  See
	|C-indenting|.

						*'cinoptions'* *'cino'*
'cinoptions' 'cino'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+cindent|
			feature}
	The 'cinoptions' affect the way 'cindent' reindents lines in a C
	program.  See |C-indenting|.

						*'cinwords'* *'cinw'*
'cinwords' 'cinw'	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without both the
			|+cindent| and the |+smartindent| features}
	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
	'smartindent' or 'cindent' is set.  For 'cindent' this is only done at
	an appropriate place (inside {}).

						*'cmdheight'* *'ch'*
'cmdheight' 'ch'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of lines to use for the command line.  Helps avoiding
	|hit-return| prompts.

						*'columns'* *'co'*
'columns' 'co'		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.

						*'comments'* *'com'*
'comments' 'com'	string	(default
				"sr:/*,mb:*,el:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	A comma separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
	insert a space.

			       *'compatible'* *'cp'* *'nocompatible'* *'nocp'*
'compatible' 'cp'	toggle	(default on, off when a .vimrc file is found)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the function of making Vim either more Vi-compatible,
	or behave in a more useful way.  This is a special kind of option,
	because when it's set or reset, other options are also changed as a
	side effect.  CAREFUL: Setting or resetting this option can have a lot
	of unexpected effects: Mappings are interpreted in another way, undo
	behaves differently, etc.
	By default this option is on and the Vi defaults are used for the
	options.  This default was chosen for those people who want to use Vim
	just like Vi, and don't even (want to) know about the 'compatible'
	option.
	When a ".vimrc" file is found while Vim is starting up, this option is
	switched off, and all options that have not been modified will be set
	to the Vim defaults.  Effectively, this means that when a ".vimrc"
	file exists, Vim will use the Vim defaults, otherwise it will use the
	Vi defaults.  Also see |compatible-default|.
	You can also set this option with the "-C" argument, and reset it with
	"-N".  See |-C| and |-N|.
	Switching this option off makes the Vim defaults be used for options
	that have a different Vi and Vim default value.  See the options
	marked with a '+' below.  Other options are not modified.
	At the moment this option is set, several other options will be set
	or reset to make Vim as Vi-compatible as possible.  See the table
	below.  This can be used if you want to revert to Vi compatible
	editing.
	See also 'cpoptions'.

						*'complete'* *'cpt'*
'complete' 'cpt'	string	(default: ".,b")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It indicates the type of completion
	and the places to scan.  It is a comma separated list of flags:
	.	scan the current buffer.
	w	scan other windows.
	b	scan other loaded buffers.
	u	scan the unloaded buffers.
	k	scan the files given with the 'dictionary' option.
	k[dict]	scan the file [dict].  Several "k" flags can be given,
		patterns are valid too.  For example:
>			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
	i	scan current and included files.
	]	tag completion.
	t	same as "]".

	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
	(gziped files for example)

	A nice value is:
>		:set cpt=.,b,u

	As U can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any 'iskeyword'-
	based expansion (eg dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, include
	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tag |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions)

						*'cpoptions'* *'cpo'*
'cpoptions' 'cpo'	string	(Vim default: "aABceFs",
				 Vi default:  all flags)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
	this indicates vi-compatible behaviour.  This is used for things where
	not being vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
	'cpoptions' stands for 'compatibleoptions'.
	Commas can be added for readability.

	    contains	behaviour	~
		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
			the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
			the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
			include the '|' in the mapping.  Applies to all
			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
			See also |map_bar|.
		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
			abbreviations and the "to" part of the menu commands.
			Remove this flag to be able to use a backslash like a
			CTRL-V.  This flag must be removed to be able to fully
			use the <> notation.  For example, the command
			":map X \<Esc>" results in X being mapped to:
				'B' included:	"\^["    (^[ is a real <Esc>)
				'B' excluded:   "<Esc>"  (5 characters)
				('<' excluded in both cases)
		<	Disable the recognition of special key codes in |<>|
			form in mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of
			menu commands.  For example, the command
			":map X <Tab>" results in X being mapped to:
				'<' included:   "<Tab>"  (5 characters)
				'<' excluded:   "^I"     (^I is a real <Tab>)
			Also see the 'k' flag below.
		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
			cursor position.  When not present searching continues
			one character from the cursor position.  With 'c'
			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
			"/abab", without 'c' there are five matches.
		d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
			tags file in the current directory.
		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command line
			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
			at least one character is to be operate on.  Example:
			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current
			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
			yet.
		j	When joining lines, only add two spaces after a '.',
			not after '!' or '?'.  Also see 'joinspaces'.
		k	Disable the recognition of raw key codes in
			mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of menu
			commands.  For example, if <Key> sends ^[OA (where ^[
			is <Esc>), the command ":map X ^[OA" results in X
			being mapped to:
				'k' included:   "^[OA"   (3 characters)
				'k' excluded:   "<Key>"  (one key code)
			Also see the '<' flag above.
		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]" is special  See |/[]|
			   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
			   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
		L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin' and
			'textwidth' count a <Tab> as two characters, instead
			of the normal behaviour of a <Tab>.
		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
			a second or until a character is typed.  |'showmatch'|
		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
			next search.
		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
			command, instead of the actually used search string.
		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
			set when the buffer is created.
		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
			(except 'readonly' and 'fileformat').  This is the
			(most) Vi compatible setting.
			The options are set to the values in the current
			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
			buffer options global to all buffers.

			's'    'S'     copy buffer options
			no     no      when buffer created
			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)

		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
			last used search pattern.
		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
		w	When using "cw" on a blank character, only change one
			character and not all blanks until the start of the
			next word.
		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
		x	<Esc> on the command line executes the command line.
			The default in Vim is to abandon the command line,
			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
			line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
			point.
		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
			used -filter- command is used.
		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.

						*'define'* *'def'*
'define' 'def'		string	(default "^#\s*define")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The 'isident' option is
	used to recognize the identifier name after the match.  See
	|option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space or
	backslash.
	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
	useful, to include const type declarations:
>		^\(#\s*define\|[a-z]*\s*const\s*[a-z]*\)
	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!

						*'dictionary'* *'dict'*
'dictionary' 'dict'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
	preferred).
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	Where to find a list of words?
	- On FreeBSD, there is the file "/usr/share/dict/words".
	- In the Simtel archive, look in the "msdos/linguist" directory.
	- In "miscfiles" of the GNU collection.

				     *'digraph'* *'dg'* *'nodigraph'* *'nodg'*
'digraph' 'dg'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+digraphs|
			feature}
	Enable the entering of digraphs in Insert mode with {char1} <BS>
	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.

						*'directory'* *'dir'*
'directory' 'dir'	string	(default for Amiga: ".,t:",
				 for MS-DOS and Win32: ".,c:\tmp,c:\temp"
				 for Unix: ".,~/tmp,/tmp")
			global
	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
	  possible.
	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
	  impossible!).
	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for MS-DOS et.al.) means to
	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example:
>	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
	discouraged, when the system crashes you lose the swap file.  That is
	why a "tmp" directory in your home directory is used first.
	{Vi: directory to put temp file in, defaults to "/tmp"}

			   *'ed'* *'edcompatible'* *'noed'* *'noedcompatible'*
'edcompatible' 'ed'	toggle	(default off)
			global
	Makes the 'g' and 'c' flags of the ":substitute" command to be
	toggled each time the flag is given.  See |complex-change|.  See
	also 'gdefault' option.

			       *'endofline'* *'eol'* *'noendofline'* *'noeol'*
'endofline' 'eol'	toggle	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and this option is off and the 'binary' option
	is on, no <EOL> will be written for the last line in the file.  This
	option is automatically set when starting to edit a new file, unless
	the file does not have an <EOL> for the last line in the file, in
	which case it is reset.  Normally you don't have to set or reset this
	option.  When 'binary' is off the value is not used when writing the
	file.  When 'binary' is on it is used to remember the presence of a
	<EOL> for the last line in the file, so that when you write the file
	the situation from the original file can be kept.  But you can change
	it if you want to.

			     *'equalalways'* *'ea'* *'noequalalways'* *'noea'*
'equalalways' 'ea'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on all the windows are automatically made the same size after
	splitting or closing a window.  When off, splitting a window will
	reduce the size of the current window and leave the other windows the
	same.  When closing a window the extra lines are given the the window
	above it.

						*'equalprg'* *'ep'*
'equalprg' 'ep'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	External program to use for "=" command.  When this option is empty
	the internal formatting functions are used ('lisp' or 'cindent').
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.

			       *'errorbells'* *'eb'* *'noerrorbells'* *'noeb'*
'errorbells' 'eb'	toggle	(default off)
			global
	Ring the bell (beep or screen flash) for error messages.  This only
	makes a difference for error messages, the bell will be used always
	for a lot of errors without a message (e.g., hitting <Esc> in Normal
	mode).  See 'visualbell' on how to make the bell behave like a beep,
	screen flash or do nothing.

						*'errorfile'* *'ef'*
'errorfile' 'ef'	string	(Amiga default: "AztecC.Err",
					others: "errors.err")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the QuickFix mode (see |:cf|).
	When the "-q" command line argument is used, 'errorfile' is set to the
	following argument.  See |-q|.
	NOT used for the ":make" command.  See 'makeef' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'errorformat'* *'efm'*
'errorformat' 'efm'	string	(default is very long)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Scanf-like description of the format for the lines in the error file
	(see |errorformat|).

				     *'esckeys'* *'ek'* *'noesckeys'* *'noek'*
'esckeys' 'ek'		toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Function keys that start with an <Esc> are recognized in Insert
	mode.  When this option is off, the cursor and function keys cannot be
	used in Insert mode if they start with an <Esc>.  The advantage of
	this is that the single <Esc> is recognized immediately, instead of
	after one second.  Instead of resetting this option, you might want to
	try changing the values for 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen'.  Note that
	when 'esckeys' is off, you can still map anything, but the cursor keys
	won't work by default.

						*'eventignore'* *'ei'*
'eventignore' 'ei'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A list of autocommand event names, which are to be ignored.
	When set to "all", all autocommand events are ignored, autocommands
	will not be executed.
	Otherwise this is a comma separated list of event names.  Example:
>	    :set ei=WinEnter,WinLeave

				 *'expandtab'* *'et'* *'noexpandtab'* *'noet'*
'expandtab' 'et'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	In Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a
	<Tab>.  Spaces are used in indents with the '>' and '<' commands and
	when 'autoindent' is on.  To insert a real tab when 'expandtab' is
	on, use CTRL-V<Tab>.  See also |:retab| and |ins-expandtab|.

					*'exrc'* *'ex'* *'noexrc'* *'noex'*
'exrc' 'ex'		toggle (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enables the reading of .vimrc, .exrc and .gvimrc in the current
	directory.  If you switch this option on you should also consider
	setting the 'secure' option (see |initialization|).  Using a local
	.exrc, .vimrc or .gvimrc is a potential security leak, use with care!
	also see |.vimrc| and |gui-init|.

					*'fileformat'* *'ff'*
'fileformat' 'ff'	string (DOS, Win32, OS/2 default: "dos",
				Unix default: "unix",
				Macintosh default: "mac")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
	    dos	    <CR> <NL>
	    unix    <NL>
	    mac	    <CR>
	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformat' is ignored, file I/O
	works like it was set to "unix'.
	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
	'fileformats' is not empty and 'binary' is off.
	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to "dos",
	'textmode' is set, otherwise 'textmode' is reset.

					*'fileformats'* *'ffs'*
'fileformats' 'ffs'	string (Vim+Vi	DOS, Win32, OS/2 default: "dos,unix",
				Vim	Unix default: "unix,dos",
				Vim	Mac default: "mac,unix,dos",
				Vi	others default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried.  It is
	used when starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into
	an existing buffer:
	- When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
	  always.  It is not set automatically.
	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix, 'fileformat'
	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is prefered over "dos".
	  3. If 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
	     This means that "mac" is only choosen when "unix" is not present,
	     or when no <NL> is found in the file, and when "dos" is not
	     present, or no <CR><NL> is present in the file.
	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
	     'fileformats' is used.
	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
	  file only, the option is not changed.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
	done:
	- When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
	  format will be used.
	- When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
	  used.
	Also see |file-formats|.
	For backwards compatibility: When this option is set to an empty
	string or one format (no comma is included), 'textauto' is reset,
	otherwise 'textauto' is set.

					 *'fkmap'* *'fk'* *'nofkmap'* *'nofk'*
'fkmap' 'fk'		toggle  (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Farsi character set.
	Normally you would use CTRL-_ in insert mode to toggle this option.
	See |farsi.txt|.

					*'formatoptions'* *'fo'*
'formatoptions' 'fo'	string (Vim default: "tcq", Vi default: "vt")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  When the 'paste' option is
	on, no formatting is done (like 'formatoptions' is empty).  Commas can
	be inserted for readability.

						*'formatprg'* *'fp'*
'formatprg' 'fp'	string (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
	selected with the "gq" command.  The program must take the input on
	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
	such a program.  If this option is an empty string, the internal
	format function will be used |C-indenting|.  Environment variables are
	expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
	and backslashes.

				   *'gdefault'* *'gd'* *'nogdefault'* *'nogd'*
'gdefault' 'gd'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the ":substitute" flag 'g' is default on.  This means that
	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a 'g' flag
	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.

	This option tells Vim what the cursor should look like in different
	modes.  The option is a comma separated list of parts.  Each part
	consist of a mode-list and an argument-list:
		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode
		c	Command line Normal (append) mode
		ci	Command line Insert mode
		cr	Command line Replace mode
		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
		a	all modes
	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
			[only one of the above three should be present]
		blinkwait{N}				*cursor-blinking*
		blinkon{N}
		blinkoff{N}
			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
			cursor is not shown.  The times are in msec.  When one
			of the numbers is zero, there is no blinking.  The
			default is: "blinkwait700-blinkon400-blinkoff250".
			These numbers are used for a missing entry.  This
			means that blinking is enabled by default.  To switch
			blinking off you can use "blinkon0".  The cursor only
			blinks when Vim is waiting for input, not while
			executing a command.
			To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see
			tools/blink.c.
		{group-name}
			a highlight group name, that sets the color and font
			for the cursor
	Examples of parts:
	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	in Normal, Command-lne and Visual mode, use a
				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
				highlight group
	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
	   			30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
				faster.

	The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
	to do awcommon setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
	blinking: "a:blinkon0"

	Examples of cursor highlighting:
>	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
>	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg

						*'guifont'* *'gfn'*
'guifont' 'gfn'		string  (default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{Only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This is a list of fonts which should be tried when starting the GUI
	version of vim.  The fonts are separated with commas.  Spaces after a
	comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name precede it with
	a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra backslash before a
	space and a backslash.  See also |option-backslash|.  For example:
>	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
	will make vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails
	it will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.
	Win32 only:
>	    :set guifont=*
	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.
	If none of the fonts can be loaded, vim will try using other resource
	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.
	For the Win32 GUI
	- takes these options in the font name:
		hXX - height is XX (points)
		wXX - width is XX (points)
		b   - bold
		i   - italic
		u   - underline
		s   - strikeout
	  Use a ':' to separate the options.
	- A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
	- Example:
>	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b
	See also |font-sizes|.

						*'guioptions'* *'go'*
'guioptions' 'go'	string  (default "agmr" (Unix) or "gmr")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{Only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of vim.  It is a
	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
	GUI should be used.  Valid letters are as follows:

	  'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
		is automatically yanked into the <"*> selection register.
		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
		by a yank or delete operation.

	  'f'	Foreground: Don't use fork() to detatch the GUI from the shell
		where it was started.  Use this for programs that wait for the
		editor to finish (e.g., an e-mail program).  Altenatively you
		can use "gvim -f" or ":gui -f" to start the GUI in the
		foreground.  |gui-fork|

	  'm'	Menu bar is present when 'm' is included.
	  'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
		'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.

	  'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when 'r' is included.
	  'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when 'l' is included.
	  'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present when 'b' is included.

	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.

						*'guipty'* *'noguipty'*
'guipty'		toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{Only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	Only in the GUI: If on, an attempt is made to open a pseudo-tty for
	I/O to/from shell commands.  See |gui-pty|.

					*'helpfile'* *'hf'*
'helpfile' 'hf'		string	(default (Amiga) "vim:doc/help.txt"
					 (MSDOS) "$VIM\doc\help.txt"
				 	 (others) "$VIM/doc/help.txt")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Name of the help file.  All help files should be placed together in
	one directory.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For
	example: "$VIM/doc/help.txt".  If $VIM is not set, $HOME is also
	tried.  Also see |$VIM|.  |option-backslash| about including spaces
	and backslashes.

						*'helpheight'* *'hh'*
'helpheight' 'hh'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
	current window, or (when the 'ea' option is on) the same as other
	windows.  When the height is less than 'helpheight', the height is
	set to 'helpheight'.  Set to zero to disable.

				     *'hidden'* *'hid'* *'nohidden'* *'nohid'*
'hidden' 'hid'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When off the current buffer is unloaded when it is abandoned.  When
	on the current buffer becomes hidden when starting to edit another
	buffer.  If the current buffer is also displayed in another window it
	does not become hidden, of course.  The commands that move through the
	buffer list sometimes make the current buffer hidden although the
	'hidden' option is off: When the buffer is modified, 'autowrite' is
	off or writing is not possible, and the '!' flag was used.  See also
	|windows.txt|.

						*'highlight'* *'hl'*
'highlight' 'hl'	string	(default (split in pieces):
				     "8:SpecialKey,@:NonText,d:Directory,
				     e:ErrorMsg,i:IncSearch,l:Search,m:MoreMsg,
				     M:ModeMsg,n:LineNr,r:Question,
				     s:StatusLine,t:Title,
				     v:Visual,w:WarningMsg")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option can be used to set highlighting mode for various
	occasions.  It is a comma separated list of character pairs.  The
	first character in a pair gives the occasion, the second the mode to
	use for that occasion.  The occasions are:
	|hl-SpecialKey|	 8  Meta & special keys listed with ":map"
	|hl-NonText|	 @  '~' and '@' at the end of the window and
			    characters from 'showbreak'
	|hl-Directory|	 d  directories in CTRL-D listing and other special
			    things in listings
	|hl-ErrorMsg|	 e  error messages
			 h  (obsolete, ignored)
	|hl-IncSearch|	 i  'incsearch' highlighting
	|hl-Search|	 l  last search pattern highlighting (see 'hlsearch')
	|hl-MoreMsg|	 m  |more-prompt|
	|hl-ModeMsg|	 M  Mode (e.g., "-- INSERT --")
	|hl-LineNr|	 n  line number for ":number" and ":#" commands
	|hl-Question|	 r  |hit-return| prompt and yes/no questions
	|hl-StatusLine|	 s  status lines
	|hl-Title|	 t  Titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
	|hl-Visual|	 v  Visual mode
	|hl-WarningMsg|	 w  warning messages

	The display modes are:
		r	reverse		(termcap entry "mr" and "me")
		i	italic		(termcap entry "ZH" and "ZR")
		b	bold		(termcap entry "md" and "me")
		s	standout	(termcap entry "so" and "se")
		u	underline	(termcap entry "us" and "ue")
		n	no highlighting
		-	no highlighting
		:	use a highlight group
	The default is used for occasions that are not included.
	If you want to change what the display modes do, see |dos-colors|
	for an example.
	When using the ':' display mode, this must be followed by the name of
	a highlight group.  A highlight group can be used to define any type
	of highlighting, including using color.  See |:highlight| on how to
	define one.  The default uses a different group for each occasion.
	See |highlight-default| for the default highlight groups.

				 *'hlsearch'* *'hls'* *'nohlsearch'* *'nohls'*
'hlsearch' 'hls'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}
	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
	The type of highlighting used can be set with the 'l' occasion in the
	'highlight' option.  This uses the "Search" highlight group by
	default.  Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
	are not applied.
	See also: 'incsearch'.
	When you switch this option on and off very often, it's a good idea to
	make a mapping for this.  Example:
>		:map <F7> :set hls!<CR>
	Here is a mapping that also echoes the current value:
>		:map <F7> :set hls!<CR><Bar>:echo "HLSearch: " . strpart("OffOn", 3 * &hlsearch, 3)<CR>

						*'history'* *'hi'*
'history' 'hi'		number	(Vim default: 20, Vi default: 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
	are remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).

					 *'hkmap'* *'hk'* *'nohkmap'* *'nohk'*
'hkmap' 'hk'		toggle  (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Hebrew character set.
	Normally you would use CTRL-_ in insert mode to toggle this option.
	See |rightleft.txt|.

				 *'hkmapp'* *'hkp'* *'nohkmapp'* *'nohkp'*
'hkmapp' 'hkp'		toggle  (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, phonetic keyboard mapping is used.  'hkmap' must also be on.
	This is useful if you have a non-Hebrew keyboard.
	See |rightleft.txt|.

						*'icon'* *'noicon'*
'icon'			toggle	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on the icon of the window will be set to the name of the file
	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
	Overridden by the 'iconstring' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons (currently
	only Unix xterm and iris-ansi).  When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11
	defined, the original icon will be restored if possible |X11|.

						*'iconstring'*
'iconstring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this options is not empty, it will be used for the icon of the
	window.  This happens regardless of the 'icon' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons (currently
	only Unix xterm and iris-ansi).  When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11
	defined, the original icon will be restored if possible |X11|.

			       *'ignorecase'* *'ic'* *'noignorecase'* *'noic'*
'ignorecase' 'ic'	toggle	(default off)
			global
	Ignore case in search patterns.  Also used when searching in the tags
	file.

						*'include'* *'inc'*
'include' 'inc'		string	(default "^#\s*include")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
	"]I", "[d", etc..  The 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file
	name that comes after the matched pattern.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.

				 *'incsearch'* *'is'* *'noincsearch'* *'nois'*
'incsearch' 'is'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}
	While typing a search pattern, show immediately where the so far
	typed pattern matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the
	pattern is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will
	be updated often, this is only useful on fast terminals.  Note that
	the match will be shown, but the cursor is not actually positioned
	there.  You still need to finish the search command with <CR> to move
	the cursor.  The highlighting can be set with the 'i' flag in
	'highlight'.  See also: 'hlsearch'.

			       *'infercase'* *'inf'* *'noinfercase'* *'noinf'*
'infercase' 'inf'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
	'ignorecase' is also on, the case of the match is adjusted.  If the
	typed text contains a lowercase letter where the match has an upper
	case letter, the completed part is made lower case.  If the typed text
	has no lower case letters and the match has a lower case letter where
	the typed text has an upper case letter, and there is a letter before
	it, the completed part is made uppercase.

			       *'insertmode'* *'im'* *'noinsertmode'* *'noim'*
'insertmode' 'im'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Makes Vim work in a way that Insert mode is the default mode.  Useful
	if you want to use Vim as a modeless editor.
	These Insert mode commands will be useful:
	- Use the cursor keys to move around.
	- Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command |i_CTRL-O|).
								*i_CTRL-L*
	- Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use
	  <Esc> to get back to Insert mode.

	These items change when 'insertmode' is set:
	- when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.
	- <Esc> in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.
	- <Esc> in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.
	  WARNING: this means that mappings that rely on the behaviour of
	  <Esc> will not work!
	- CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.
	- CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim, see |CTRL-Z|.	*i_CTRL-Z*

						*'isfname'* *'isf'*
'isfname' 'isf'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
					    "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:,\"
				 for AMIGA: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:"
				 otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,$,:,~")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are included in file names and
	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
	the tags file.  Besides the characters in this option characters that
	are defined by the C function isalpha() are also always included
	(this depends on the character set and "locale").

	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
	character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
	not work for digits).  Example:
		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
					128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
	If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
	included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
	option or the end of a range.  Example:
		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
	If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
	plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
				case letters.
		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
	expected.  Example:
		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, command and underscore.
	A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
				comma, plus <Tab>.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'isident'* *'isi'*
'isident' 'isi'		string	(default for MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2:
					   "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				otherwise: "@,48-57,_,192-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are included in identifiers.
	Identifiers are used in recognizing environment variables and after
	a match of the 'define' option.  See 'isfname' for a description of
	the format of this option.
	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding
	environment variables.  E.g., when '/' is included and Vim tries to
	expand "$HOME/.viminfo".  Maybe you should change 'iskeyword' instead.

						*'iskeyword'* *'isk'*
'iskeyword' 'isk'	string (Vim default for MS-DOS and Win32:
					    "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				   otherwise:  "@,48-57,_,192-255"
				Vi default: "@,48-57,_")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Keywords are used in searching and recognizing with many commands:
	"w", "*", "[i", etc.  See 'isfname' for a description of the format of
	this option.  For C programs you could use "a-z,A-Z,48-57,_,.,-,>".
	For a help file it is set to all non-blank printable characters except
	'*', '"' and '|'.  When the 'lisp' option is on the '-' character is
	always included.

						*'isprint'* *'isp'*
'isprint' 'isp'	string	(default for MS-DOS and Win32: "@,~-255"
				  otherwise:           "@,161-255")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The characters given by this option are displayed directly on the
	screen.  The characters from space (ascii 32) to '~' (ascii 126) are
	always displayed directly, even when they are not included in
	'isprint' or excluded.  See 'isfname' for a description of the format
	of this option.  Non-printable characters are displayed with two
	characters:
		  0 -  31	"^@" - "^_"
		 32 - 126	always single characters
		   127		"^?"
		128 - 159	"~@" - "~_"
		160 - 254	"| " - "|~"
		   255		"~?"

			       *'joinspaces'* *'js'* *'nojoinspaces'* *'nojs'*
'joinspaces' 'js'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Insert two spaces after a '.', '?' and '!' with a join command.
	When 'cpoptions' includes the 'j' flag, only do this after a '.'.
	Otherwise only one space is inserted.

					*'keywordprg'* *'kp'*
'keywordprg' 'kp'	string	(default "man", "view /" for OS/2)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the "K" command.  Environment variables are
	expanded |:set_env|.  When empty ":help" is used.  See
	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

					*'langmap'* *'lmap'*
'langmap' 'lmap'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+langmap|
			feature}
	This option allows support for keyboards that have a mode for a
	special language.  The idea is that when you are typing text in Insert
	mode your keyboard is switched in the special language mode, you get
	different key codes for the special characters.  When in command mode
	the 'langmap' option takes care of translating these special
	characters to the original meaning of the key.  This means you don't
	have to change the keyboard mode to be able to execute normal mode
	commands.

	Example (for greek):					*greek*
>	    :set langmap=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,QQ,R,S,T,U,V,WW,X,Y,Z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,qq,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z
	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands):
>	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ

	The 'langmap' option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
	part can be in one of two forms:
	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
	";", ',' and backslash itself.

	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

					*'laststatus'* *'ls'*
'laststatus' 'ls'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
	status line:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two windows
		2: always
	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
	windows, but it takes another screen line.

					*'lazyredraw'* *'lz'*
'lazyredraw' 'lz'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
	typed.

			       *'linebreak'* *'lbr'* *'nolinebreak'* *'nolbr'*
'linebreak' 'lbr'	toggle	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	If on Vim will wrap long lines at a character in 'breakat' rather
	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
	'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth', this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.  The
	value of 'showbreak' is used to put in front of wrapped lines.  This
	option is not used when the 'wrap' option is off.  Note that <Tab>
	characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed correctly.

						*'lines'*
'lines'			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
			global
	Number of lines in the display.  Normally you don't need to set this.
	That is done automatically by the terminal initialization code.  When
	you do set this, and Vim is unable to change the physical number of
	lines on the display, redisplaying may be wrong.

						*'lisp'* *'nolisp'*
'lisp'			toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Lisp mode: When a return is typed in insert mode set the indent for
	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
	"cc" or "S".  'autoindent' must also be on for this to work.  The '-'
	character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the "="
	operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than calling an
	external program if 'equalprg' is empty.  This option is reset when
	'paste' is set.  {Vi: Does it a little bit differently}

						*'list'* *'nolist'*
'list'			toggle	(default off)
			local to window
	List mode: Show tabs as CTRL-I, show end of line with $.  Useful to
	see the difference between tabs and spaces and for trailing blanks.
	Note that this will also affect formatting (set with 'textwidth' or
	'wrapmargin') when 'cpoptions' includes 'L'.

						*'magic'* *'nomagic'*
'magic'			toggle	(default on)
			global
	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
	See |pattern|.

						*'makeef'* *'mef'*
'makeef' 'mef'		string	(Amiga default: "t:vim##.Err",
					  Unix: "/tmp/vim##.err",
					others: "vim##.err")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the ":make" command (see |:make_makeprg|).
	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
	existing file.
	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See 'errorfile' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'makeprg'* *'mp'*
'makeprg' 'mp'		string	(default "make")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.  This
	option may contain '%' and '#' characters, which are expanded like
	when used in a command line.  Environment variables are expanded
	|:set_env|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces and
	backslashes.

						*'matchtime'* *'mat'*
'matchtime' 'mat'	number  (default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}{in Nvi}
	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when 'showmatch' is
	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

						*'maxmapdepth'* *'mmd'*
'maxmapdepth' 'mmd'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
	because the 'w' is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
	|key-mapping|.

						*'maxmem'* *'mm'*
'maxmem' 'mm'		number	(default 512)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for one buffer.  When this
	limit is reached allocating extra memory for a buffer will cause
	other memory to be freed.  See also 'maxmemtot'.

						*'maxmemtot'* *'mmt'*
'maxmemtot' 'mmt'	number	(default 2048, or half the amount of memory
				available)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for all buffers together.
	See also 'maxmem'.

				   *'modeline'* *'ml'* *'nomodeline'* *'noml'*
'modeline' 'ml'		toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			local to buffer
						*'modelines'* *'mls'*
'modelines' 'mls'	number	(default 5)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If 'modeline' is on 'modelines' gives the number of lines that is
	checked for set commands.  If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is zero
	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.  'modeline' is reset when
	'compatible' is set.

				 *'modified'* *'mod'* *'nomodified'* *'nomod'*
'modified' 'mod'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When on the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
	by every command that makes a change to the buffer.  Only the undo
	command may reset it, when all changes have been undone.

						*'more'* *'nomore'*
'more'			toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
	listing continues until finished.
	When 'compatible' is set this option is reset.

						*'mouse'*
'mouse'			string	(default "", "a" for MS-DOS and Win32)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Enable the use of the mouse.  Only works for certain terminals
	(MS-DOS, Win32 |win32-mouse| and xterm).  For using the mouse in the
	GUI, see |gui-mouse|.
	The mouse can be enabled for different modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-return| prompt
	Normally you would enable the mouse in all four modes with:
		:set mouse=a
	Note: Normal copy/paste in an xterm can still be used by pressing the
	shift key when the mouse is being used by Vim.  See |mouse-using|.

			*'mousehide'* *'mh'* *'nomousehide'* *'nomh'*
'mousehide' 'mh'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only works in the GUI}
	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

						*'mousetime'* *'mouset'*
'mousetime' 'mouset'	number	(default 500)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Only for GUI, MS-DOS, Win32 and Unix with xterm.  Defines the maximum
	time in msec between two mouse clicks for the second click to be
	recognized as a multi click.

							*'nrformats'* *'nf'*
'nrformats' 'nf'	string	(default "octal,hex")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
	If "octal" is included, numbers that start with a zero will be
	considered to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in
	"010".
	If "hex" is included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
	considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on "0x100"
	results in "0x0ff".
	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
	recognized as octal or hex.

				       *'number'* *'nu'* *'nonumber'* *'nonu'*
'number' 'nu'		toggle	(default off)
			local to window
	Print the line number in front of each line.  Tip: If you don't like
	wrapping lines to mix with the line numbers, set the 'showbreak'
	option to eight spaces:
		:set showbreak=\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 

						*'paragraphs'* *'para'*
'paragraphs' 'para'	string	(default "IPLPPPQPP LIpplpipbp")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate paragraphs.  These are pairs
	of two letters (see |object-motions|).

						*'paste'* *'nopaste'*
'paste'			toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Put Vim in Paste mode.  This is useful if you want to cut or copy
	some text from one window and paste it in Vim.  This will avoid
	unexpected effects.  When the 'paste' option is switched on (also when
	it was already on):
		- mapping in Insert mode is disabled
		- abbreviations are disabled
		- 'textwidth' is set to 0
                - 'wrapmargin' is set to 0
		- 'autoindent' is reset
		- 'smartindent' is reset
		- 'cindent' is reset
                - 'softtabstop' is set to 0
		- 'lisp' is reset
		- 'revins' is reset
		- 'ruler' is reset
		- 'showmatch' is reset
		- 'formatoptions' is used like it is empty
	NOTE: When you start editing another file while the 'paste' option is
	on, settings from the modelines or autocommands may change the
	settings again, causing trouble when pasting text.  You might want to
	set the 'paste' option again.
	When the 'paste' option is reset the mentioned options are restored to
	the value before the moment 'paste' was switched from off to on.
	Resetting 'paste' before ever setting it does not have any effect.  If
	you use this often, you could map a function key to the command ":set
	invpaste^V^M".

						*'patchmode'* *'pm'*
'patchmode' 'pm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is edited a copy
	of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the name
	of the original file with the string in the 'patchmode' option
	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
	".org".  'backupdir' must not be empty for this to work (Detail: The
	backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the new file has
	been succesfully written, that's why it must be possible to write a
	backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an empty file is
	created.

						*'path'* *'pa'*
'path' 'pa'		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
				   on OS/2:       ".,/emx/include,,"
				   other systems: ".,,")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	gf, [f, ]f, ^Wf and other commands, provided that the file being
	searched for has a relative path (not starting with '/').  The
	directories in the 'path' option may be relative or absolute.
	- Use commas to separate directory names:
		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space:
	  	:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
	  backslash:
	  	:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
	- To search relative to the directory where the current file is use
	  	:set path=.
	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
	  commas:
		:set path=,,
	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Use wildcards to specify directories more freely, e.g.,
		:set path=/usr/include/*
	  means all subdirectories below /usr/include (but not /usr/include
	  itself).
	- Use '**' if you want the whole subtree to be searched:
		:set path=/home/user_x/src/**
	  means search in the whole subtree under "/home/usr_x/src". (to avoid
	  endless recursions, the depth is restricted to 100 levels)
	- Give wildcards and recursions in any order:
		:set path=/**/include/**
	  specifies a path with at least one directory /include/ in it.
	- The set of allowed wildcards and the possible usage depend on the
	  operating system, but /etc/*/etc and /etc/**/etc work on any
	  system. |:_%<|
	- Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option:
		:set path=.,c:\\include
	  Or just use '/' instead:
		:set path=.,c:/include
	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
	the file!
	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
	'path', see |:checkpath|.

				   *'readonly'* *'ro'* *'noreadonly'* *'noro'*
'readonly' 'ro'		toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	If on, writes fail unless you use a '!'.  Protects you from
	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
	{not in Vi:}  When using the ":view" command the 'readonly' option is
	set for the newly edited buffer.  When using ":w!" the 'readonly'
	option is reset for the current buffer.

						*'remap'* *'noremap'*
'remap'			toggle	(default on)
			global
	Allows for mappings to work recursively.  If you do not want this for
	a single entry, use the :noremap[!] command.

						*'report'*
'report'		number	(default 2)
			global
	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
	changed lines is more than 'report' a message will be given for most
	":" commands.  For the ":substitute" command the number of
	substitutions is used instead of the number of lines.

			 *'restorescreen'* *'rs'* *'norestorescreen'* *'nors'*
'restorescreen' 'rs'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}  {Windows 95/NT version only}
	When set, the screen contents is restored when exiting Vim.  This also
	happens when executing external commands.

	For non-Windows Vim: You can set or reset the 't_ti' and 't_te'
	options in your .vimrc.  To disable restoring:
		set t_ti= t_te=
	To enable restoring (for an xterm):
		set t_ti=^[7^[[r^[[?47h t_te=^[[?47l^[8
	(Where ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to insert it)

				       *'revins'* *'ri'* *'norevins'* *'nori'*
'revins' 'ri'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-B
	command in Insert mode.  This option is reset when 'compatible' or
	'paste' is set.

				 *'rightleft'* *'rl'* *'norightleft'* *'norl'*
'rightleft' 'rl'	toggle	(default off)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft|
			feature}
	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., character
	that are stored in the file apear from the right to the left.  Using
	this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that are
	written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.  This
	option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
	sometimes usefull when editing Hebrew TeX--XeT files).  See
	|rightleft.txt|.

					 *'ruler'* *'ru'* *'noruler'* *'noru'*
'ruler' 'ru'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
	comma.  Each window has its own ruler.
	If a window has a status line, the ruler is shown there.  Otherwise it
	is shown in the last line of the screen.
	If there are characters in the line that take two positions on the
	screen, both the "real" column and the screen column are shown,
	separated with a dash.
	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
	This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.

						*'scroll'* *'scr'*
'scroll' 'scr'		number	(default 'lines' / 2)
			local to window
	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
	changes.  If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
	be used as the new value for 'scroll'.  Reset to 'lines' / 2 with
	":set scroll=0".   {difference from vi: 'scroll' gives the number of
	screen lines instead of file lines, makes a difference when lines
	wrap}

						*'scrolljump'* *'sj'*
'scrolljump' 'sj'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.

						*'scrolloff'* *'so'*
'scrolloff' 'so'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
	when long lines wrap).

						*'sections'* *'sect'*
'sections' 'sect'		string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

						*'secure'* *'nosecure'*
'secure'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, ":autocmd", shell and write commands are not allowed in
	".vimrc" and ".exrc" in the current directory and map commands are
	displayed.  Switch it off only if you know that you will not run into
	problems, or when the 'exrc' option is off.  On Unix this option is
	only used if the ".vimrc" or ".exrc" is not owned by you.  This can be
	dangerous if the systems allows users to do a "chown".  You better set
	'secure' at the end of your ~/.vimrc then.

						*'shell'* *'sh'*
'shell' 'sh'		string	(default $SHELL or "sh",
					MS-DOS and Win32: "command",
					OS/2: "cmd")
			global
	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
	value also check the 'shelltype', 'shellpipe' and 'shellredir'
	options.  It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.
	"csh -f".  See |option-backslash| about including spaces and
	backslashes.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.

						*'shellcmdflag'* *'shcf'*
'shellcmdflag' 'shcf'	string	(default: "-c", MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell'
					does not contain "sh" somewhere: "/c")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
	"bash.exe -c ls" or "command.com /c dir".  For the MS-DOS-like
	systems, the default is set according to the value of 'shell', to
	reduce the need to set this option by the user.  It's not used for
	OS/2 (EMX figures this out itself).  See |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.  See |dos-shell|.

						*'shellpipe'* *'sp'*
'shellpipe' 'sp'	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	For the Amiga and MS-DOS the default is ">".  The output is directly
	saved in a file and not echoed to the screen.
	For Unix the default it "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the 'shell' option is "csh" or
	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh", "zsh" or "bash" the default becomes
	"2>&1| tee".  This means that stderr is also included.
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).

						*'shellquote'* *'shq'*
'shellquote' 'shq'	string	(default: ""; MS-DOS and Win32, when 'shell'
					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
	quoting.  See 'shellxquoute' to include the redirection.  It's
	probably not useful to set both options.
	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
	third-party shells on MS-DOS-like systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
	the value of 'shell', to reduce the need to set this option by the
	user.  See |dos-shell|.

						*'shellredir'* *'srr'*
'shellredir' 'srr'	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String to be used to put the output of a filter in a temporary file.
	See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces and
	backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the 'shell' option is "csh", "tcsh"
	or "zsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh" or "bash" the default becomes
	">%s 2>&1".  This means that stderr is also included.
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the ".vimrc"
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellredir' option changes automatically unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).

						*'shelltype'* *'st'*
'shelltype' 'st'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	On the Amiga this option influences the way how the commands work
	which use a shell.
	0 and 1: always use the shell
	2 and 3: use the shell only to filter lines
	4 and 5: use shell only for ':sh' command
	When not using the shell, the command is executed directly.

	0 and 2: use "shell 'shellcmdflag' cmd" to start external commands
	1 and 3: use "shell cmd" to start external commands

						*'shellxquote'* *'sxq'*
'shellxquote' 'sxq'	string	(default: "";
					for Win32, when 'shell' contains "sh"
					somewhere: "\""
					for Unix, when using system(): "\"")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
	'shellxquoute' to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
	to set both options.
	This is an empty string by default.  Known to be useful for
	third-party shells when using the Win32 version, such as the MKS Korn
	Shell or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted
	according the value of 'shell', to reduce the need to set this option
	by the user.  See |dos-shell|.

			       *'shiftround'* *'sr'* *'noshiftround'* *'nosr'*
'shiftround' 'sr'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'.  Applies to > and <
	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
	a multiple of 'shiftwidth' (this is vi compatible).

						*'shiftwidth'* *'sw'*
'shiftwidth' 'sw'	number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.

						*'shortmess'* *'shm'*
'shortmess' 'shm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-return| prompts caused by file
	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
	It is a list of flags:
	 flag	meaning when present	~
	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
	  l	use "999L, 888C" instead of "999 lines, 888 characters"
	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message.
	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]" instead of
		"[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac format]".
	  a	all of the above abbreviations

	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent message
		for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when 'autowrite' on)
	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or "search
		hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages
	  t	trunctate file message at the start if it is too long to fit
		on the command line, "<" will appear in the left most column.
	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing swap file
		is found.
	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim |:intro|.

	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
	requires you to hit return, but still gives as useful a message as
	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
	would have got with 'shm' empty, use ":file!"
	Useful values:
	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

				 *'shortname'* *'sn'* *'noshortname'* *'nosn'*
'shortname' 'sn'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi, not in MS-DOS versions}
	Filenames are assumed to be 8 characters plus one extension of 3
	characters.  Multiple dots in file names are not allowed.  When this
	option is on, dots in file names are replaced with underscores when
	adding an extension (".~" or ".swp").  This option is not available
	for MS-DOS, because then it would always be on.  This option is useful
	when editing files on an MS-DOS compatible filesystem, e.g., messydos
	or crossdos.

						*'showbreak'* *'sbr'*
'showbreak' 'sbr'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
	values are "> " or "+++ ".  Only printable characters are allowed,
	excluding <Tab> and comma (in a future version the comma might be used
	to separate the part that is shown at the end and at the start of a
	line).  The characters are highlighted according to the '@' flag in
	'highlight'.

				     *'showcmd'* *'sc'* *'noshowcmd'* *'nosc'*
'showcmd' 'sc'		toggle	(Vim default: on, off for Unix, Vi default:
				 off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the  |+showcmd|
			feature}
	Show (partial) command in status line.  Set this option off if your
	terminal is slow.

				 *'showmatch'* *'sm'* *'noshowmatch'* *'nosm'*
'showmatch' 'sm'	toggle	(default off)
			global
	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
	show the match can be set with 'matchtime'.
	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
	seen or not).  This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set.
	When the 'm' flag is not included in 'cpoptions', typing a character
	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
	See the "sm" field in 'guicursor' for setting the cursor shape and
	blinking when showing the match.

				 *'showmode'* *'smd'* *'noshowmode'* *'nosmd'*
'showmode' 'smd'	toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
	Use the 'M' flag in 'highlight' to set the type of highlighting for
	this message.

						*'sidescroll'* *'ss'*
'sidescroll' 'ss'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
	the 'wrap' option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  When using
	a fast terminal use a small number or 1.  Not used for "zh" and "zl"
	commands.

			       *'smartcase'* *'scs'* *'nosmartcase'* *'noscs'*
'smartcase' 'scs'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Override the 'ignorecase' option if the search pattern contains upper
	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
	'ignorecase' option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc..

			     *'smartindent'* *'si'* *'nosmartindent'* *'nosi'*
'smartindent' 'si'	toggle	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+smartindent| feature}
	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  'cindent' does
	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
	see |C-indenting|.  When 'cindent' is on, setting 'si' has no effect.
	Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent'.
	An indent is automatically inserted:
	- After a line ending in '{'.
	- After a line starting with a keyword from 'cinwords'.
	- Before a line starting with '}' (only with the "O" command).
	When typing '}' as the first character in a new line, that line is
	given the same indent as the matching '{'.
	When typing '#' as the first character in a new line, the indent for
	that line is removed, the '#' is put in the first column.  The indent
	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with '#' are not shifted
	right.
	'smartindent' is reset when the 'paste' option is set.

				 *'smarttab'* *'sta'* *'nosmarttab'* *'nosta'*
'smarttab' 'sta'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts 'shiftwidth' positions,
	'tabstop' in other places.  When off a <Tab> always inserts 'tabstop'
	positions, 'shiftwidth' is only used for ">>" and the like.  See also
	|ins-expandtab|.

					*'softtabstop'* *'sts'*
'softtabstop' 'sts'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
	used.  This is useful to keep the 'ts' setting at its standard value
        of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to 'sts'.  However,
        commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
        When 'sts' is zero, this feature is off.
	'softtabstop' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.
        See also |ins-expandtab|.

			       *'splitbelow'* *'sb'* *'nosplitbelow'* *'nosb'*
'splitbelow' 'sb'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, spliting a window will put the new window below the current
	one.

			   *'startofline'* *'sol'* *'nostartofline'* *'nosol'*
'startofline' 'sol'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
	blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", , and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
	with a linewise operator and with "%" with a count.  This option is
	set when the 'compatible' option is set.

						*'suffixes'* *'su'*
'suffixes' 'su'		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Files with these suffixes are ignored when multiple files match a
	wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
	the start of a suffix.  To include a dot or comma in a suffix, precede
	it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about including spaces and
	backslashes).

						*'swapsync'* *'sws'*
'swapsync' 'sws'	string	(default "fsync")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this option is not empty a swap file is synced to disk after
	writing to it.  This takes some time, especially on busy unix systems.
	When this option is empty parts of the swap file may be in memory and
	not written to disk.  When the system crashes you may lose more work.
	On Unix the system does a sync now and then without Vim asking for it,
	so the disadvantage of setting this option off is small.  On some
	systems the swap file will not be written at all.  For a unix system
	setting it to "sync" will use the sync() call instead of the default
	fsync(), which may work better on some systems.

					*'tabstop'* *'ts'*
'tabstop' 'ts'		number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
	|:retab| command, and 'softtabstop' option.

			*'tagbsearch'* *'tbs'* *'notagbsearch'* *'notbs'*
'tagbsearch' 'tbs'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Binary searching is first used in the tags files, when searching for a
	tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command).  This makes searching for a tag a
	LOT faster.  When no match was found in any of the files listed in
	'tags', a retry is done with a linear search.  Tags in unsorted tags
	files, and matches with different case will only be found in the
	retry.
	When this option is off, only the linear search is done.  This makes
	tags searching slower when a full match exists, but faster when no
	full match exists.  The number of tags found doesn't change, only the
	order in which they are found.
	This option doesn't affect the |:tselect| command, and other commands
	that find all matching tags (e.g., command line completion).
	{Vi: always uses binary search in some versions}

						*'taglength'* *'tl'*
'taglength' 'tl'	number	(default 0)
			global
	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

			*'tagrelative'* *'tr'* *'notagrelative'* *'notr'*
'tagrelative' 'tr'	toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If on and using a tag file in another directory, file names in that
	tag file are relative to the directory where the tag file is.  When
	the 'compatible' option is set, this option is reset.

						*'tags'* *'tag'*
'tags' 'tag'		string	(default "./tags,tags", when compiled with
				|+emacs_tags|: "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS")
			global
	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
	When a file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path
	of the current file.  But only when the 'd' flag is not included in
	'cpoptions'.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
	|tags-option|.
	If Vim was compiled with the |+emacs_tags| feature, Emacs-style tag
	files are also supported.  They are automatically recognized.  The
	default value becomes "./tags,./TAGS,tags,TAGS".  |emacs-tags|
	{Vi: default is "tags /usr/lib/tags"}

						*'term'*
'term'			string	(default is $TERM, if that fails:
					 on Unix: "ansi"
				        on Amiga: "amiga"
				       on MS-DOS: "pcterm"
				         on OS/2: "os2ansi"
				       on Win 32: "win32")
			global
	Name of the terminal.  Used for choosing the terminal control
	characters.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	For example:
>		:set term=$TERM
	See |termcap|.

						*'terse'* *'noterse'*
'terse'			toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When set: Add 's' flag to 'shortmess' option (this makes the message
	for a search that hits the start or end of the file not being
	displayed).  When reset: Remove 's' flag from 'shortmess' option.  {Vi
	shortens a lot of messages}

				   *'textauto'* *'ta'* *'notextauto'* *'nota'*
'textauto' 'ta'		toggle	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformats'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textauto' is set, 'fileformats' is
	set to the default value for the current system.  When 'textauto' is
	reset, 'fileformats' is made empty.

				   *'textmode'* *'tx'* *'notextmode'* *'notx'*
'textmode' 'tx'		toggle	(MS-DOS, Win32 and OS/2: default on,
				 others: default off)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option is obsolete.  Use 'fileformat'.
	For backwards compatibility, when 'textmode' is set, 'fileformat' is
	set to "dos".  When 'textmode' is reset, 'fileformat' is set to
	"unix".

						*'textwidth'* *'tw'*
'textwidth' 'tw'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
	this.  'textwidth' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set.  When
	'textwidth' is zero, 'wrapmargin' may be used.  See also
	'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.

			     *'tildeop'* *'top'* *'notildeop'* *'notop'*
'tildeop' 'top'		toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.

				*'timeout'* *'to'* *'notimeout'* *'noto'*
'timeout' 'to'		toggle (default on)
			global
						*'ttimeout'* *'nottimeout'*
'ttimeout'		toggle (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	These two options together determine the behaviour when part of a
	mapped key sequence or keyboard code has been received:

	timeout		ttimeout	action	~
	off		off		no time out
	on		on or off	time out on :mappings and key codes
	off		on		time out on key codes

	If there is no time out, Vim will wait until either the complete
	mapping or key sequence has been received, or it is clear that there
	is no mapping or key sequence for the received characters.  For
	example: if you have mapped "vl" and Vim has received 'v', the next
	character is needed to see if the 'v' is followed by an 'l'.  With a
	time out Vim will wait for about 1 second for the next character to
	arrive.  After that the already received characters are interpreted
	as single characters.  The waiting time can be changed with the
	'timeoutlen' option.
	On slow terminals or very busy systems time out may cause
	malfunctioning cursor keys.  If both options are off, Vim waits
	forever after an entered <Esc> if there are key codes that start
	with <Esc>.  You will have to type <Esc> twice.  If you do not have
	problems with key codes, but would like to have :mapped key
	sequences not time out in 1 second, set the ttimeout option and
	reset the timeout option.

						*'timeoutlen'* *'tm'*
'timeoutlen' 'tm'	number	(default 1000)
			global
			{not in all versions of Vi}
						*'ttimeoutlen'* *'ttm'*
'ttimeoutlen' 'ttm'	number	(default -1)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for a key code or mapped key
	sequence to complete.  Normally only 'timeoutlen' is used and
	'ttimeoutlen' is -1.  When a different timeout value for key codes is
	desired set 'ttimeoutlen' to a non-negative number.

		ttimeoutlen	mapping delay	   key code delay	~
	           < 0          'timeoutlen'       'timeoutlen'
	          >= 0          'timeoutlen'       'ttimeoutlen'

	The timeout only happens when the 'timeout' and 'ttimeout' options
	tell so.  A useful setting would be
		:set timeout timeoutlen=3000 ttimeoutlen=100
	(time out on mapping after three seconds, time out on key codes after
	a tenth of a second).

						*'title'* *'notitle'*
'title'			toggle	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on the title of the window will be set to "VIM - filename",
	where filename is the name of the file currently being edited.  Only
	works if the terminal supports setting window titles (currently Amiga
	console, Unix xterm and iris-ansi).  Overridden by the 'titlestring'
	option.
								*X11*
	When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11 defined, the original title will
	be restored if possible.  The output of ":version" will include "+X11"
	when HAVE_X11 was defined, otherwise it will be "-X11".  This also
	works for the icon name |'icon'|.
	If the title cannot be restored, it is set to "Thanks for flying Vim".
	You will have to restore the title outside of Vim then.  When using an
	xterm from a remote machine you can use this command:
	    rsh machine_name xterm -display $DISPLAY &
	then the WINDOWID environment variable should be inherited and the
	title of the window should change back to what it should be after
	exiting Vim (rather than using the "Thanks..." message).

								*'titlelen'*
'titlelen'		number	(default 85)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Gives the percentage of 'columns' to use for the length of the window
	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
	shown.  A '>' character is used to indicate this.  Using a percentage
	makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But it won't work
	perfectly, because the actual number of characters available also
	depends on the font used and other things in the title bar.  When
	'titlelen' is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise, values from 1 to
	30000 can be used.  'titlelen' is not used for the 'titlestring'
	option.

						*'titlestring'*
'titlestring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When this options is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
	window.  This happens regardless of the 'title' or 'titlelen' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles (currently
	only Unix xterm and iris-ansi).  When Vim was compiled with HAVE_X11
	defined, the original title will be restored if possible |X11|.
	Example:
>		let hostname = expand("`hostname`")
>		auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname . "/" . expand("%:p")

			     *'ttybuiltin'* *'tbi'* *'nottybuiltin'* *'notbi'*
'ttybuiltin' 'tbi'	toggle	(default on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When on, the builtin termcaps are searched before the external ones.
	When off the builtin termcaps are searched after the external ones.
	When this option is changed, you should set the 'term' option next for
	the change to take effect, for example:
>		:set notbi term=$TERM
	See also |termcap|.

				     *'ttyfast'* *'tf'* *'nottyfast'* *'notf'*
'ttyfast' 'tf'		toggle	(default off, on when 'term' is xterm, hpterm,
					sun-cmd, scren, dtterm or iris-ansi)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Indicates a fast terminal connection.  More characters will be sent to
	the screen for redrawing, instead of using insert/delete line
	commands.  Improves smoothness of redrawing when there are multiple
	windows and the terminal does not support a scrolling region.
	Also enables the extra writing of characters at the end of each screen
	line for lines that wrap.  This helps when using copy/paste with the
	mouse in an xterm and other terminals.

						*'ttyscroll'* *'tsl'*
'ttyscroll' 'tsl'	number	(default 999)
			global
	Maximum number of lines to scroll the screen.  If there are more lines
	to scroll the window is redrawn.  For terminals where scrolling is
	very slow and redrawing is not slow this can be set to a small number,
	e.g., 3, to speed up displaying.

						*'ttytype'* *'tty'*
'ttytype'	'tty'		string	(default from $TERM)
			global
	Alias for 'term', see above.

						*'undolevels'* *'ul'*
'undolevels' 'ul'		number	(default 100, 1000 for Unix and OS/2)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Set to 0 for Vi
	compatibility: one level of undo and "u" undoes itself.  But you can
	also get Vi compatibility by including the 'u' flag in 'cpoptions',
	and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.  Set to a negative
	number for no undo at all (saves memory).

						*'updatecount'* *'uc'*
'updatecount' 'uc'	number	(default: 200)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
	recovery |crash-recovery|).  'updatecount' is set to zero by starting
	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.  Also see |'swapsync'|.

						*'updatetime'* *'ut'*
'updatetime' 'ut'	number	(default 4000)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).

						*'verbose'* *'vbs'*
'verbose' 'vbs'		number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	When bigger than zero, Vim will give messages about what it is doing.
	Currently, these messages are given:
	>= 1	When a file is ":source"'ed.
	>= 1	When the viminfo file is read or written.
	>= 8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
	>= 9	Every executed autocommand.

	This option can also be set with the "-V" argument.  See |-V|.

						*'viminfo'* *'vi'*

'viminfo' 'vi'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the  |+viminfo|
			feature}
	When non-empty, the viminfo file is read upon startup and written
	when exiting Vim (see |viminfo-file|).  The string should be a comma
	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
	the effect of their value.
	CHAR	VALUE	~
	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
		'viminfo' is non-empty.
	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  Case is
		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
		characters.
	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
		saved.  Dont forget to put a backslash before the ", otherwise
		it will be recognized as the start of a comment!
	:	Maximum number of items in the command line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
		'history' is used.
	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
		the 'n'.  Must be the last one!  If the "-i" argument was
		given when starting Vim, that file name overrides the one
		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are expanded
		when opening the file, not when setting the option.
	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
		buffer list is restored from the viminfo file.  Buffers
		without a file name and buffers for help files are not written
		to the viminfo file.

	Example:
>	    :set viminfo='50,\"1000,:0,n~/vim/viminfo

	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
			edited.
	"1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
			remembered.
	:0		Command line history will not be saved.
	n~/vim/viminfo	The name of the file to use is "~/vim/viminfo".
	no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
			previous search and substitute patterns.
	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.

			*'visualbell'* *'vb'* *'novisualbell'* *'novb'* *beep*
'visualbell' 'vb'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Use visual bell instead of beeping.  The terminal code to display the
	visual bell is given with 't_vb'.  When no beep of flash is wanted,
	use ":set vb t_vb=".  Does not work on the Amiga, you always get a
	screen flash.  Also see 'errorbells'.

						*'warn'* *'nowarn'*
'warn'			toggle	(default on)
			global
	Give a warning message when a shell command is used while the buffer
	has been changed.

		     *'weirdinvert'* *'wiv'* *'noweirdinvert'* *'nowiv'*
'weirdinvert' 'wiv'	toggle	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	This option has the same effect as the 't_xs' termcap option.
	It is provided for backwards compatibility with version 4.x.
	Setting 'weirdinvert' has the effect of making 't_xs' non-empty, and
	vise versa.  Has no effect when the GUI is running.

						*'whichwrap'* *'ww'*
'whichwrap' 'ww'	string	(Vim default: "b,s", Vi default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to wrap to the
	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
		char   key	  mode	~
		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual
		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual
		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
		 >    <Right> 	 Normal and Visual
		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
	For example:
>		:set ww=<,>,[,]
	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
	cursor.
	When 'l' is included, you get a side effect: "yl" on an empty line
	will include the <EOL>, so that "p" will insert a new line.
	When 'compatible' is set, 'whichwrap' is set to "".

						*'wildchar'* *'wc'*
'wildchar' 'wc'		number	(Vim default: <Tab>, Vi default: CTRL-E)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
	command line.  CTRL-E is used when the 'compatible' option is set.
	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  Although
	'wc' is a number option, you can set it to a special key: ":set
	wc=<Esc>".

						*'winheight'* *'wh'*
'winheight' 'wh'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  If the current
	window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of the height
	of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window always
	fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.  The
	height is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
	height of the current window.

						*'wrap'* *'nowrap'*
'wrap'			toggle	(default on)
			local to window
			{not in Vi}
	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll horizontally
	(also see 'sidescroll' option and |wrap-off|).  If you want to break
	long lines, see 'textwidth'.

						*'wrapmargin'* *'wm'*
'wrapmargin' 'wm'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
	and inserting continues on the next line.  When 'textwidth' is
	non-zero, this option is not used.  See also 'formatoptions' and
	|ins-textwidth|.  {Vi: works differently and less useful}

				   *'wrapscan'* *'ws'* *'nowrapscan'* *'nows'*
'wrapscan' 'ws'		toggle	(default on)
			global
	Searches wrap around the end of the file.

				   *'writeany'* *'wa'* *'nowriteany'* *'nowa'*
'writeany' 'wa'		toggle	(default off)
			global
	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

			     *'writebackup'* *'wb'* *'nowritebackup'* *'nowb'*
'writebackup' 'wb'	toggle	(default on with |+writebackup| feature, off
					otherwise)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
	the file was successfully written, unless the 'backup' option is
	also on.  Reset this option if your file system is almost full.  See
	|backup-table| for another explanation.

						*'writedelay'* *'wd'*
'writedelay' 'wd'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not in Vi}
	The number of microseconds to wait for each character sent to the
	screen.  When non-zero, characters are sent to the terminal one by
	one.  For MS-DOS pcterm this does not work.  For debugging purposes.
