		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file contains an alphabetical list of messages and error messages that
Vim produces.  You can use this if you don't understand what the message
means.  It is not complete though.

1. Error messages	|error-messages|
2. Messages		|messages|

==============================================================================
1. Error messages					*error-messages*

When an error message is displayed, but it is removed before you could read
it, you can see it again with:
>  echo errmsg


>  Ambiguous mapping

The first argument for a ":map" command starts with the same character(s) as
an already existing mapping.  Note that keys like <F1> often start with "^[[".
Check the output of ":set termcap" for that.  All variations of the ":map"
command give the same message: ":cmap", ":imap", etc.


>  Command not allowed from exrc/vimrc in current dir or tag search

Some commands are not allowed for security reasons.  These commands mostly
come from a .exrc or .vimrc file in the current directory, or from a tags
file.  Also see 'secure'.


>  File exists (use ! to override)

You are protected from accidently overwriting a file.  When you want to write
anyway, use the same command, but add a "!" just after the command.  Example:
>	:w /tmp/test
changes to:
>	:w! /tmp/test


>  GUI cannot be used: Not enabled at compile time

You are running a version of Vim that doesn't include the GUI code.  Therefore
"gvim" and ":gui" don't work.


>  Mark has invalid line number

You are using a mark that has a line number that doesn't exist.  This can
happen when you have a mark in another file, and some other program has
deleted lines from it.


>  No alternate file

The alternate file is not defined yet.  See |alternate-file|.


>  No file name

The current buffer has no name.  To write it, use ":w fname".  Or give the
buffer a name with ":file fname".


>  No previous substitute regular expression

When using the '~' character in a pattern, it is replaced with the previously
used pattern in a ":substitute" command.  This fails when no such command has
been used yet.  See |/~|.


>  No previous regular expression

When using an empty search pattern, the previous search pattern is used.  But
that is not possible if there was no previous search.


>  No such mapping

You have used an ":unmap" or ":unabbreviate" command with an argument which is
not an existing mapping.  All variations of these commands give the same
message: ":cunmap", ":iunabbrev", etc.


>  No write since last change (use ! to override)

You are trying to abandon a file that has changes.  Vim protects you from
losing your work.  You can either write the changed file with ":w", or, if you
are sure, abandon it anyway, and lose all the changes.  This can be done by
adding a '!' character just after the command you used.  Example:
>	:e other_file
changes to:
>	:e! other_file


>  Only one file name allowed

The ":edit" command only accepts one file name.  When you want to specify
several files for editing use ":next" |:next|.


>  Out of memory!

Oh, oh.  You must have been doing something complicated, or some other program
is consuming your memory.  Be careful!  Vim is not completely prepared for an
out-of-memory situation.  First make sure that any changes are saved.  Then
try to solve the memory shortage.  To stay on the safe side, exit Vim and
start again.  Also see |msdos-limitations|.


>  'readonly' option is set (use ! to override)

You are trying to write a file that was marked as read-only.  To write the
file anyway, either reset the 'readonly' option, or add a '!' character just
after the command you used.  Example
>	:w
changes to:
>	:w!


>  Scripts nested too deep

Scripts can be read with the "-s" command line argument and with the ":source"
command.  The script can then again read another script.  This can continue
for about 14 levels.  When more nesting is done, Vim assumes that there is a
recursive loop somewhere and stops with this error message.


>  Too many file names

When expanding file names, more than one match was found.  Only one match is
allowed.


>  ml_get: invalid lnum:

This is an internal Vim error.  Please try to find out how it can be
reproduced, and submit a bug report |bugreport.vim|.

2. Messages						*messages*

This is an overview of various messages that Vim gives:

							*hit-return*
>  Press RETURN or enter command to continue
This message is given when there is something on the screen for you to read,
and the screen is about to be redrawn:
- After executing an external command (e.g., ":!ls" and "=").
- Something is displayed on the status line that is longer than the width of
  the window, or runs into the 'showcmd' or 'ruler' output.

Hit <CR> or <Space> to redraw the screen and continue, without that key being
used otherwise.  Or hit ":" or any other Normal mode command character to
start that command.  {Vi: only ":" commands are interpreted}

To reduce the number of hit-return prompts:
- Set 'cmdheight' to 2 or higher.
- Add flags to 'shortmess'.
- Reset 'showcmd' and/or 'ruler'.

Also see 'mouse'.  It is highlighted with the |hl-Question| group.


							*more-prompt*
>  -- More --
>  -- More -- (RET: line, SPACE: page, d: half page, q: quit)
This message is given when the screen is filled with messages.  It is only
give when the 'more' option is on.  It is highlighted with the |hl-MoreMsg|
group.

Type:
     <CR> or <NL>		for one more line
     <Space>			for the next page
     'd'			for down half a page
     'q', <Esc> or CTRL-C	to stop the listing
     ':'	    		to stop the listing and enter a command line
Any other key causes the meaning of the keys to be displayed.

Note: The typed key is directly obtained from the terminal, it is not mapped
and typeahead is ignored.
