Known problems and priority improvements:

GUI:
- Motif: Scrollbar for cmdline disappears with ":set go=", ":set go=lbrm".
- Motif: Tear-off menu item "----------" crashes Vim on some machines.
  (Netherton)
- When font shape changes, but not the size, doing ":set font=" does not
  redraw the screen with the new font.
- Horizontal scrollbar doesn't work in rightleft mode.

MSDOS:
- Error in the DJGPP version: ":r!ls" eats file descriptors.  After a few
  times Vim crashes with an illegal instruction under Windows 95.  Looks like
  the system() library function of DJGPP is wrong.  Sometimes Vim gives errors
  like "File creation error", "Can't read file volaaaaa", and when exiting:
  "Can't write viminfo file vomaaaaa!".
- ":n doc\*.txt" doesn't work, have to use ":n doc/*.txt" instead.

Windows 95:
- ":e $VIM/.vimrc" doesn't work.
- When 'lines' is set in _vimrc or columns is not 80, executing external
  commands sometimes hangs or crashes Vim or the PC.  This is a Windows 95
  problem.
- There is an occasional lockup when repeating a key while scrolling.  Vim
  unlocks when resizing the window.  Might be a Windows 95 problem.
- Dead keys don't work properly with Windows 95.  Not really a Vim problem,
  but it should work.  It's difficult to fix...
- Screen updating is slow with Windows 95 (compared to 16 bit version, DJGPP
  version is in between).  It becomes fast when 'lines' or 'columns' is set to
  a non-standard value!!!
- Editing a file by it's short file name and writing it, makes the long file
  name disappear.

AIX 4:
- After running Vim tty setting "cs8" is not restored, it becomes "cs5".  This
  causes 8 bit characters to loose their 8th bit.  Only with AIX 4, AIX 3 is
  fine. (Albayrak)

hpterm: Highlighting isn't always correct.  Could use 'weirdinvert', but that
	slows down screen updating too much.

I can't reproduce these:

With backupdir=~/tmp,/tmp nowritebackup nobackup patchmode=.smr 
	and the patchmode file exists, backup files in the tmp directory are left
	lying around - they should be deleted! (Riehm)

[These have been reported for version 3.0, they may not appear in this version]
Some terminals start inverting at the position where the invert code is put.
	This is not handled correctly. Remove 'weirdinvert' hack.
On Diamond Viper 132x43 mode crash on exit (John Lange)
MSDOS: After writing on a network the 'w' bit for others is set.


Documentation:

Give names to some messages, e.g. hit-return, file (buffer?) message, etc. Use
	the same name everywhere.
Autocommand example: use ":retab! 4" when reading, ":retab! 8" when writing.
Replace "toggle" with "boolean" for options?
Make a few sample menu sets (.gvimrc files) for novice vi users, novice Vim
	users, C programmers, ...


Problems that will probably not be solved:

Problem with HPterm under X: old contents of window is lost (Cosentino).
Amiga: When using quickfix with the Manx compiler we only get the first 25
	errors. How do we get the rest?
Amiga: The ":cq" command does not always abort the Manx compiler. Why?
Linux: A file with protection r--rw-rw- is seen readonly for others. The
	access() function in GNU libc is probably wrong.
MSDOS: When using smardrive with write-back buffering, writing to a readonly
	floppy will cause problems. How to test for writable floppy first?
When doing a CTRL-Z and typing a command for the shell, while Vim is busy
	(e.g. writing a file), the command for the shell is sometimes eaten by
	Vim, because the terminal mode is changed from RAW to CBREAK.
Set boolean options on/off with ":set paste=off", ":set paste=on".


Main changes for version 5.0:
- Syntax coloring/highlighting, configurable for different languages.
- Add scripting language support (probably Perl).
- GUI version for Windows (3.1/95/NT).
- The last few things for Vi compatibility (POSIX compatible mode, "Q"?).
- VINE (Vim Is Not Emacs): Keep it small!


Further extentions and improvements:

GUI stuff (see ":help gui_todo").

Make "5dd" on last-but-one-line not delete anything (vi compatible).
	Change cursor_down()???  Many other commands will change too: "5j", "c5j",
	etc.  Add flag in 'cpoptions'?
CTRL-I and CTRL-O should work in Visual mode, but only jump to marks in the
	current buffer.
Include variation on text objects, without the white space (e.g. "vp" only
	selects the paragraph, not the following empty lines).
Searching: "/this//that/" should find "that" after "this".
	":/this//that/" should find "that" after "this", this being one address.
incsearch is incorrect for "/that/<Return>/this/;//" (last search pattern
	isn't updated).
Disallow setting the 'shell', 'makeprg', 'formatprg' or 'keywordprg' options
	in a modeline???  Also 'secure' and 'exrc' should be forbidden.
Multiple tags: CTRL-] again jumps to next tag?
Add flag in 'cpoptions' that makes <BS> after a count work like <Del> (Sayre).
Add flag in 'cpoptions' that makes operator (yank, filter) not move the
	cursor, at least when canceled. (default vi compatible).
MSDOS: Support the use of "~" for $HOME.  Expand $VAR in file names.
Search commands in a tags file: Allow optional "e", "b" and "s" flags to
	position the cursor in the right column.
findmatchlimit() should be able to skip comments.
Add redirecting of Ex commands.  Add a command to dump all the settings,
	mappings, autocommands, etc. in a file, to be included in a bug report.
Using a tags file relative to the current file, and 'tags' contains
	"./../tags", the file name becomes "/path/dir/a/../b/file.c".  Should
	remove the ".." from the name of the tags file.  Should not always use
	absolute path. (Hiebert)
Detect textmode after executing the autocommands, otherwise the .gz
	autocommands don't work for MS-DOS.  Needs to be able to remove the ^Ms at
	the end of each line.  Alternative: don't use a filter command, write the
	file, gunzip, set nobin, delete the lines, read the file.
When hitting <Esc> or CTRL-C in Normal mode, give a message to help novice
	users to get out: "Type  :q!  to quit Vim".
"6x" at end of line should not break a mapping (vi compatible).
	"6X" at start of line should beep, but not break a mapping (vi compatible).
	But "6hll" at start of line does break!
Add :delcr command:
							*:delcr*
    :[range]delcr[!]	Check [range] lines (default: whole buffer) for lines
			ending in <CR>.  If all lines end in <CR>, or [!] is
			used, remove the <CR> at the end of lines in [range].
			A CTRL-Z at the end of the file is removed.
			If [range] is omitted, or it is the whole file, and
			all lines end in <CR> 'textmode' is set.  {not in Vi}
Should integrate addstar() and file_pat_to_reg_pat().
Make it possible to enter a digraph after "r" (with CTRL-K).
Autoconf: Use @datadir@ for the system independent files.  Make sure the
	system dependend and system independed files are separated. (Leitner).
When working over a serial line with 7 bit characters, remove meta characters
	from 'isprint'.
Change 'smarttab' into an option to make <Tab> always insert 'shiftwidth'
	characters?  Better: behave like 'ts' is 'shiftwidth', but write files
	like 'ts' is 8.
	Alternative: Add 'softtab': Possibility to keep 'ts' at 8 and insert
	'softtab' characters when <Tab> is hit.
MSDOS: look for .vimrc, helpfile and .viminfo in argv0 dir. (Ferenc)
Add autoconf check for waitpid()/wait4().
Add autoconf check for library path "/usr/lib" and remove it (like for
	/usr/include).
Always output <CR><NL> to the screen, never just <NL>. (Olaf Seibert)
Option to make all swap file names start with ".", to make them hidden
	(Grundman).
Use fchdir() in init_homedir(), like in FullName().
In win_update(), when the GUI is active, always use the scrolling area.  Avoid
	that the last status line is deleted and needs to be redrawn.
Vi compatibility (optional): make "ia<CR><ESC>10." do the same strange thing.
	(only repeat insert for the first line).
Make marks present in .viminfo usable as file marks: Display a list of "last
	visited files" and select one to jump to.
Add ":echo" command, display a message.
Include turbo_loader patches, speeding up reading a file.
Include regexp {n,m} patches/webb.regexp.
Change request: "/^$\|the" finds both empty lines and "the", but "/the\|^$"
	doesn't.  Make '^' after "\|" also a special character?
Call maketitle() whenever curbuf->b_changed is set or reset, and include
	"Vim +" in the title for changed buffers.  How about the icon?
Add events to autocommands:?
	normalenter  - Entering normal mode.
	insertenter  - Entering insert mode.
	replaceenter - Entering replace mode.
	cmdenter     - Entering cmdline mode.
	visualenter  - Entering visual mode.
Implement mouse support for the Amiga.
Give better error messages by using errno (strerror()).
Add 'sidescrolloff' option, like 'scrolloff' for sideways scrolling.
Make 'restorescreen' option also work for xterm (and others), replaces the
	SAVE_XTERM_SCREEN define.
When 'wrap' is off, add commands to scroll screen left/right by half the
	screen width: "zH" and "zL"?
Include an option (or flag to 'cpoptions') that makes errors in mappings not
	flush the rest of the mapping (like nvi does).
Implement a "sticky" help window, some help text lines that are always
	displayed in a window with fixed height. (Guckes)  Use "~/.vimhelp" file,
	user can edit it to insert his favorite commands, new account can contain
	a default contents.
'path' can become very long, don't use NameBuff for expansion.
Avoid calls to plines() for cursor line, use w_cline_height.
Give warning message when using ":set t_xx=asdf" for a termcap code that Vim
	doesn't know about.  Add flag in 'shortmess'?
Remove fcntl() from autoconf, all systems have it?
Add command to reset ALL options to their default value: ":set all&".
Make it possible to redo all the commands from a mapping with "."!!!
Make it possible to undo all the commands from a mapping, including a trailing
	unfinished command, e.g. for ":map K iX^[r".
Add ":che <file>", list all the include paths which lead to this file.
"-V" command line argument: Verbose, show which .vimrc, .exrc, .viminfo files
	etc. are used for initializing.
For a commandline that has several commands (:s, :d, etc.) summarize the
	changes all together instead of for each command (e.g. for the rot13 macro).
Add command like "[I" that also shows the tree of included files.
"[p" and "]p" should use 'cindent' code if it's on (only for the first line).
":set sm^L" results in ":set s", because short names of options are also
	expanded.  Is there a better way to do this?
Set default for 'dictionary', add search for dictionary to autoconf.
Add 'wildlongest' option: Key to use to find longest common match for command
	line completion (default CTRL-L), like 'wildchar'. (Cregut)
	Also: when there are several matches, show them line a CTRL-D.
Add command line completion for '%' and '#'.
Add ":@!" command, to ":@" like what ":source!" is to ":source".
Should be possible to write to a device, e.g. ":w! /dev/null".
Add 't_normal': Used whenever t_me, t_se, t_ue or t_Zr is empty.
Improve 'cindent'
- formatting of struct/array inits:
	- The lines used to initialise the struct or array above should
	  not be considered 'continuation' lines just because the previous one
	  does not end with ';'.  If you go back line by line I think it should be
	  possible to tell the difference.  If you find a line that ends in ';',
	  then it's OK to have continuation lines.  If you find a "{", and the
	  character before it (not counting space & comments) is either ',' or
	  '=', then there should not be continuation lines.  If the character
	  before the "{" is another "{", then you have to check before that one
	  too.
- When 'cindent'ing a '}', showmatch is done before fixing the indent.  It
	looks better when the indent is fixed before the showmatch. (Webb)

":cab map test ^V| je", ":cunab map" doesn't work.  This is vi compatible!
Add command to remove (all) digraphs. (Brown)
Make it possible to toggle 'paste' in Insert mode.
Make 'paste' work without resetting other options, but override their value.
	Avoids problems when changing files and modelines or autocommands are used.
Include option to switch shell off, for secure version (impossible to switch
	on again).
For visual mode: Command to do a search for the string in the marked area. Only
	when less than two lines. Use "g/" and "g?".
Add "K" command in visual mode: use Visual text for keyword program.
CTRL-W CTRL-E and CTRL-W CTRL-Y should move the current window up or down if
	it is not the first or last window.
Include-file-search commands should look in the loaded buffer of a file (if
	there is one) instead of the file itself.
Make 'lisp' code more vi compatible.
Add 'complete' option: Which completion to be done for CTRL-N/CTRL-P in insert
	mode: 'w' for other windows, 'b' for other buffers, 'd' for dictionaries
	(Webb).
Add CTRL-A command in CTRL-X mode: show all matches.
CTRL-X CTRL-F: Use 'path' to find completions.
Add command in CTRL-X mode to add following words to the completed string
	(e.g. to complete "Pointer->element" with CTRL-X CTRL-P CTRL-W CTRL-W)
CTRL-A command: When there are leading zeros, don't use the number as octal
	(with an option?).
"g CTRL-A" and "g CTRL-X": Increment/decrement alphabetical char (a -> b -> c)?
Add ":setenv" command: set environment variable.
Add possibility for file name on the command line to be searched for in the
	'path',  when there is a special character before the file name ('<' ?).
Allow the use of wildcards in 'path'.
Add possibility in 'path' to define the top of a tree to be searched, e.g.
	":set path=.,/usr/include,~/include/**".
When unhiding a hidden buffer, put the same line at top of the window as the
	one before hiding it. Or: keep the same relative cursor position (so
	many percent down the windows).
File name put into swap file should have first part of the path replaced by
	"~user", also when editing a file in somebody else his home directory,
	to make it work from different machines (Webb).
When entering the help window, don't resize to 'helpheight' if the user has
	reduced the size before (Webb). Keep the window height that the user set
	the window to in a "preferred window height" entry for each window.
"i" flag to search command: ignore case; "u" flag: use case.
Add flag to search command to not remember it for "n", e.g. "/foo/n" (not
	remember). Also for ":s/pat//n".
Add command to display the current search pattern, substitue pattern and last
	used pattern. (Margo)
Add a command like ":cn" that jumps to the next error, but uses an open window
	for the buffer with the error if possible, and opens a new window
	otherwise. Use ":cj"?
When in replace mode and 'expandtab' set, make tab look like spaces.
When started to edit another file, make message "file 1 of 8" different (add
	"not"?).
When stdin is not a tty, and Vim reads commands from it, an error should make
	Vim exit.
Allow file name "-" as command line argument: Read file from stdin. Open
	/dev/tty for commands (use "more" "vi" or "vile" as an example how to
	do this).
Make it possible for the 'showbreak' to be displayed at the end of the line.
	Use a comma to separate the part at the end and the start of the line?
	Highlight the linebreak characters, add flag in 'highlight'.
Some string options should be expanded if they have wildcards, e.g.
	'dictionary' when it is "*.h".
Use a specific type for number and boolean options, making it possible to
	change it for specific machines (e.g. when a long is 64 bit).
Use context sensitiveness of completion to switch abbreviations and mappings
	off for :unab and :unmap.
completion of existing mappings for ":unmap", ":unab", etc.
Local mappings for a buffer. Useful for autocmds. Count for map command is
	buffer number. ":0map bar foo" = enter mapping for current buffer.
Add option for <Insert> in replace mode going to normal mode. (Nugent)
Add mappings for replace mode: ":rmap".  How do we then enter mappings for
	non-replace insert mode?
When incsearch used and hitting return, no need to search again in many cases,
	saves a lot of time in big files.
With incsearch, use CTRL-N/CTRL-P to go to next/previous match, some other key
	to copy matched word to search pattern (Alexander Schmid).
Add a next/previous possibility to "[^I" and friends. Also for multiple
	matches in the tags file.
When doing "[^I" or "[^D" add position to tag stack.
Add command to put current position to tag stack: ":push" or "gp".
Add command to put all filenames from the tag files in the argument list. When
	given an argument, only use the files where that argument matches
	(like `grep -l ident`) and jump to the first match.
Add ":grep" command. Works like ":make" but uses "grep -n" instead of "make",
	'grepprg' instead of 'makeprg', 'grepformat' instead of 'errorformat'.
Add global search commands: Instead of wrapping at the end of the buffer,
	they continue in another buffer. Use flag after search pattern: "a"
	for the next file in the argument list, "f" for file in the buffer
	list, "w" for file edited in a window. e.g. "/pat/f". Then "n" and "N"
	work through files too. "f" flag also for ":s/pat/foo/f"??? Then when
	'autowrite' and 'hidden' are both not set, ask before saving files:
	"Save modified buffer "/path/file"? (Yes/Hide/No
	Save-all/hide-All/Quit) ".
Add command to form an args list from all the buffers.
Keep a list of most recently used files for each window, use "gp" to go back
	and "gn" to go forward (like ^O and ^I for jumps) (Webb). Use ":files"
	and ":ls" to list the files in history order.
Add 'scrollmax' option, maximum number of lines to scroll display, above this
	a redraw is done.
Add ":alias" command, like ":cmap" or ":cabb", but only for the command name
	and it isn't displayed.
xterm: Implement support for visual feedback of mouse dragging.
Using right mouse button to extend a blockwise selection should attach to the
	nearest corner of the rectangle (four possible corners).
Precede mouse click by a number to simulate double clicks?!?
Change ":fixdel" into option 'fixdel', t_del will be adjusted each time t_bs
	is set? (Webb)
"gc": goto character, move absolute character positions forward, also counting
	newlines. "gC" goes backwards, "g^C" goes to absolute position
	(Weigert).
When doing CTRL-^, redraw buffer with the same topline (Demirel). Store cursor
	row and window height to redraw cursor at same percentage of window
	(Webb).
Besides remembering the last used line number of a file, also remember the
	column. Use it with CTRL-^ et. al.
When a window resizes, the line with the cursor should stay at the same
	percentage from the start of the window as it was before.
Check for non-digits when setting a number option (careful when entering
	hex codes like 0xff).
Add option to make "." redo the "@r" command, instead of the last command
	executed by it.  Also an option to make "." redo the whole mapping.
	Basically: redo the last TYPED command.
Support URL links for ^X^F in insert mode, like for "gf".
":help :s^I" should expand to ":help :substitute".
Highlight control characters on the screen: Shows the difference between 
	CTRL-X and "^" followed by "X" (Colon).
Amiga: Need terminal input for quickfix, how do we read commands from stdin?
Integrate parsing of cmdline command and parsing for expansion.
When inserting a register in insert mode with CTRL-R, don't insert comment
	leader when line wraps?
'flipcase' variable: upper/lower case pairs. (alternative: translate command,
	e.g. ":tr \248-\254 \216-\222") (From Elvis, don't like it). Insert
	comma's between pairs and allow a range, e.g. :set flipcase=a-zA-Z,..
Make the help key (<F1>) context sensitive?
Create a program that can translate a .swp file from any machine into a form
	usable by Vim on the current machine.
Add commands to push and pop all or individual options. ":setpush tw",
	":setpop tw", ":setpush all".  ":setflush" resets the option stack.
Add ":highlight" command to set highlight modes and colors (Webb).
Have a look at Elvis and Vile's highlighting methods. Also look at
	vgrind/vgrindefs.
Add option to switch on highlighting all matches from a search that are on the
	screen.  Unhighlight as soon as a command is given.
Add "." command for visual mode: redo last visual command (e.g. ":fmt").
Add "." command after operator: repeat last command of same operator. E.g.
	"c." will repeat last change, also when "x" used since then (Webb).
	Also: keep history of Normal mode commands, add command to list the
	history and/or pick an older command.
	Also: add ":history" command for command lines and search patterns.
Add support for both <M-^A> and <~A> in mappings.
Add ":noro" command: Reset 'ro' flag for all buffers, except ones that have a
	readonly file. ":noro!" will reset all 'ro' flags.
Make repeating insert faster. Don't redisplay the screen.
Add "KeyWasTyped" flag: It's reset before each command and set when a
	character from the keyboard is consumed. Value is used to decide to
	put a command line in history or not. Put line in history if it didn't
	completely resulted from one mapping.
Add a variant of CTRL-V that stops interpretation of more than one character.
	For entering mappings on the command line where a key contains several
	special characters, e.g. a trailing newline.
The ":@r" commands should take a range and execute the register for each line
	in the range.
Add regex for 'paragraphs' and 'sections': 'parare' and 'sectre'. Combine the
	two into a regex for searching. (Ned Konz)
When selecting in visual block mode, use curswant instead of cursor column.
	(Webb 97) adjust 'o' command etc.
When in blockwise visual selection (CTRL-V), allow cursor to be placed
	right of the line. Could also allow cursor to be placed anywhere on a
	TAB or other special character.
Support the "abbreviate" command in modelines (Kearns).  Careful for
	characters after <Esc>, that is a security leak.
Make it possible to set options from modelines only temporarily for that file
	(needs a stack for saving old options).
Make '2' option in 'formatoptions' also work inside comments.
Consider adding patches/list_indent (indenting for bullet lists).
When formatting a comment after some text, insert the '*' for the new line
	(indent is correct if 'cindent' is set, but '*' doesn't get inserted).
Make smartindenting configurable. Add 'sioptions', e.g. '#' setting the indent
	to 0 should be switched on/off.
For smart indent: When typing 'else' line it up with matching 'if'.
Add commands ":C", ":P" and ":X". ":C" does encryption and ":P" the same as
	":p". What should they do exactly?
When window size changed (with the mouse) and made too small, set it back to
	the minimal size.
Add "]>" and "[<", shift comment at end of line (command;  /* comment */).
Add 'mapstop' command, to stop recursive mappings.
Should not call cursorcmd() for each vgetc() in getcmdline().
Add the ex address '}', next empty line (like the "}" command).
Add command line completion for ":ilist" and friends, show matching
	identifiers (Webb).
When switching to another file and screen scrolls because of the long message
	and return must be typed, don't scroll the screen back before redrawing.
For u_save() include the column number. This can be used to set '[ and ']. And
	in the future the undo can be made more efficient (Webb).
":split file1 file2" adds two more windows (Webb).
Add the possibility to use more than one argument list: ":arglist 2".
Add command to show last search pattern and substitute string. Maybe make it
	accessible through a register ("/ for search string)?
When mouse click after 'r' command, get character that was pointed to.
For duplicate tags: Add commands ":ntag", "Ntag", ":prevtag", ":rewtag",
	:lasttag". Make CTRL-D listing of matching tags more informative. Keep
	count for tag index in the tag stack, so CTRL-T and :ta work.
Don't give message "Incomplete last line" when editing binary file.
When writing a file, name it "foo.new". Then rename "foo" to "foo.bak" and
	"foo.new" to "foo". If dir is not writable or on write error copy
	"foo" to "backupdir/foo.bak" and overwrite "foo". Check for correct
	group/owner and try to set it if not. NO: this breaks with hard links.
	INSTEAD: make Amiga and MSDOS work like unix: first make copy of file,
	then truncate and overwrite original file. Use an option for this,
	default on for Unix, off for Amiga/MSDOS (Sayre has the algorithm
	worked out).
When appending to a file, should Vim also make a backup and a 'patchmode'
	file?
Only make a backup when overwriting a file for the first time. Avoids loosing
	the original when writing twice. (Slootman)
On non-Unix machines, also overwrite the original file in some situations
	(file system full, it's a link on an NFS partition).
Add number option to ":s//2": replace second occurance of string? Or:
	:s///N substitutes N times.
Add ":a", ":i" for preloading of named buffers.
In Replace mode, tab replaces as many characters as it takes on the screen,
	text remains at the same position. Requires replace-stack to work with
	strings instead of characters? Implement 'replacealign' in a different
	way from Webb.
Allow autowrite when doing ":e file" (with an option 'eaw').
Make command line arguments options to be combined after a single dash, eg
	"-nb".
Allow a "+command" argument before each file name in the Vim command line:
	"vim +123 file1 +234 file2 +345 file3".
When entering text, keep other windows on same buffer updated (when a line
	entered)?
Bind windows together, scrolling is done in both windows synchronous
	(horizontally and vertically). Use CTRL-W b?
Change ".swp" to ".vim", because it give a hint who created the file?
Use termcap 'ts' and 'fs' entries for setting the window title. Check 'hs'
	and use minimum of 'ws' (if present) and Columns to truncate the title.
In dosub() regexec is called twice for the same line. Try to avoid this.
When line is too long to fit on screen, display part where cursor is (like
	nvi). Use an offset to the start of the first line on the screen.
Window updating from memline.c: insert/delete/replace line.
Optimize ml_append() for speed, esp. for reading a file.
V..c should keep indent when 'ai' is set, just like <count>cc.
:s///p prints the line after a substitution.
Updatescript() can be done faster with a string instead of a char.
When searching with 'n' give message when getting back where the search first
	started. Remember start of search in '/ mark.
Add option that scrolls screen to put cursor in middle of screen after search.
Add \! to search patterns: matches string that does not match previous atom.
Screen updating is inefficient with CTRL-F and CTRL-B when there are long lines.
Uppercase characters in ex commands can be made lowercase?
Filtering a block should only apply to the block, not to the whole lines. When
	the number of lines is increased, add lines. When decreased, padd with
	spaces or delete? Use ":`<,`>" on the command line.
CTRL-V :s should substitute only in the block.
CTRL-V > should move the block, not whole lines.
Add commands to move selected text, without deselecting.
Add visual command to swap selected text with unnamed buffer.
Add "P" command to insert contents of unnamed buffer, move selected text to
	position of previous deleted (to swap foo and bar in " + foo")
In out-of-memory situations: Free allocated space in undo (after asking).

Far future extentions:

Make it possible to edit a register, in a window, like a buffer.
Highlighting of different kinds of text (e.g. for showing variables, keywords).
Mode to keep C-code formatted (sort of on-line indent). Use colors for
	keywords, comments, etc.
Add Ex mode (some people like to use it).
Add macro language with real functions (Perl, TCL?).
Allow vertical splitting of screen (once?).
Option for filter when reading/writing a file for compression or crypting (-x
	command line option, -z option: gzip/gunzip).  Also for crypting the
	swap file. Support compression of documentation files.
Allow editing beyond end of line, just like there are all spaces. Switch this
	on with an option or special insert mode command. Also allow editing
	above start and below end of buffer.
When executing macro's: Save each line for undo only once.
Make undo more memory-efficient: Compare text before and after change, only
	remember the lines that really changed. When calling u_save with a
	single line, don't save it if line is already saved for undo.
When doing a global substitute, causing almost all lines to be changed, undo
	info becomes very big. Put undo info in swap file??
When inserting/deleting characters in a line, adjust marks.
Smart cut/paste: recognize words and adjust spaces before/after them.
Option verbose; when on keep the screen uptodate, when off only redisplay when
	input needed. Also possible to use Vim from a shell script.
Change the output to the message line. Don't redraw the screen until the next
	vi command. Remember message line for redraw. Integrate the command line
	in updateScreen().
Mode to keep text formatted while inserting/deleting. Use soft/hard returns
	with an option to switch this off.
Korn-shell or tcsh like command line editing (like editing a single line with
	vi). Use :cmap! for mappings. Can be implemented like a buffer containing
	command lines. Use CTRL-O instead of <Esc>, to remain vi-compatible?
Add column numbers to ":" commands ":line1,line2[col1,col2]cmd".  Block can be
	selected with CTRL-V.  Allow '$' (end of line) for col2.
Add 'hidecomment' option: don't display comments in /* */ and after //.
Add open mode, use it when terminal has no cursor positioning.
Special "drawing mode": a line is drawn where the cursor is moved to. Backspace
	deletes along the line (from jvim).
Add a command or option to save the current editing session (which files are
	open, window sizes, file positions, etc.), so it can be resumed later.
Perform commands on multiple windows (:W%s/foo/bar/g), multiple arguments (:A)
	or multiple buffers (:B). Implement ":Bset", set option in all
	buffers. Also ":Wset", set in all windows, ":Aset, set in all
	arguments and ":Tset", set in all files mentioned in the tags file.
	Add buffer/arg range, like in ":2,5B%s/..." (do we really need this???)
	Add search string: "B/*.c/%s/.."?  Or ":F/*.c/%s/.."?
Support for underlining (underscore-BS-char), bold (char-BS-char) and other
	standout modes switched on/off with , 'overstrike' option (Reiter).
Add vertical mode (Paul Jury, Demirel): "5vdw" deletes a word in five lines,
	"3vitextESC" will insert "text" in three lines, etc..
Internationalization: wide characters and multibyte char support.
When editing a readonly file, don't use a swap file but read parts from the
	original file.
Recognize l, #, p as 'flags' to EX commands:
	:g/RE/#l shall print lines with line numbers and in list format.
	:g/RE/dp shall print lines that are deleted.
	POSIX: Commands where flags shall apply to all lines written: list,
	number, open, print, substitute, visual, &, z. For other commands,
	flags shall apply to the current line after the command completes.
	Examples: :7,10j #l Join the lines 7-10 and print the result in list
